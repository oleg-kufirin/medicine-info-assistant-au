LEXAPRO belongs to a group of medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). They are thought to work by their actions on brain chemicals called amines which are involved in controlling mood. LEXAPRO is used to treat depression. Depression is longer lasting or more severe than the \"low moods\" everyone has from time to time due to the stress of everyday life. It is thought to be caused by a chemical imbalance in parts of the brain. This imbalance affects your whole body and can cause emotional and physical symptoms such as feeling low in spirit, loss of interest in activities, being unable to enjoy life, poor appetite or overeating, disturbed sleep, often waking up early, loss of sex drive, lack of energy and feeling guilty over nothing. LEXAPRO corrects this chemical imbalance and may help relieve the symptoms of depression. LEXAPRO may also be used to treat patients who may avoid and/or are fearful of social situations. LEXAPRO may also be used to treat patients who have excessive anxiety and worry. LEXAPRO may also be used to treat irrational fears or obsessional behaviour (obsessive-compulsive disorder). Obsessive-compulsive disorder involves having both obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted thoughts that occur over and over again. Compulsions are the ongoing need to repeat certain actions as a result of these thoughts. Your doctor, however, may prescribe it for another purpose. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why it has been prescribed for you. 2. What should I know before I use LEXAPRO? Warnings Do not use LEXAPRO if: • you are allergic to escitalopram oxalate, citalopram, or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. • Always check the ingredients to make sure you can use • this medicine. The packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. Check with your doctor if you: • have allergies to any other substances such as foods, preservatives or dye. Symptoms of an allergic reaction may include shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, or rash, itching or hives on the skin. • • • are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. have any other medical conditions take any medicines for any other condition If you have, or have had any of the following conditions, tell your doctor before starting LEXAPRO: • a tendency to bleed or bruise easily, or if you are pregnant (see ‘Pregnancy and breastfeeding’) diabetes heart disease kidney disease liver disease bipolar disorder (manic depression) a history of seizures or fits restlessness and/or a need to move often raised intraocular pressure (fluid pressure in the eye), or if you are at risk of angle-closure glaucoma. you are receiving electroconvulsive therapy • • • • • • • • • Medicines like LEXAPRO so called (SSRIs) may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see Section 6. Are there any side effects?). In some cases, these symptoms have continued after stopping treatment. During treatment, you may be at risk of developing certain side effects. It is important you understand these risks and how to monitor for them. See additional information under Section 6. Are there any side effects? Do not take LEXAPRO at the same time as the following other medicines: • • monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as pimozide, a medicine used to treat mental disorders. phenelzine, tranylcypromine and moclobemide which are also used for the treatment of depression. • monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as linezolid which is an antibiotic and selegiline which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. One day must elapse after you have finished taking moclobemide before you start taking LEXAPRO. If you have taken any other MAOI you will need to wait 14 days. After Lexapro® 2 stopping LEXAPRO you must allow 14 days before taking any MAOI including moclobemide. Taking LEXAPRO with MAOIs may cause a serious reaction with a sudden increase in body temperature, extremely high blood pressure and severe convulsions. Your doctor will know when it is safe to start LEXAPRO after the MAOI has been stopped. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Check with your doctor if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Medicines like LEXAPRO have been shown to reduce the quality of sperm in animal studies, which theoretically could affect fertility. If you are intending to start a family, ask your doctor for advice. When taken during pregnancy, particularly in the last three months of pregnancy, medicines like LEXAPRO may affect the general condition of your newborn baby and may increase the risk of a serious condition in babies, called persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), making the baby breathe faster and appear bluish. These symptoms usually begin during the first 24 hours after the baby is born. If this happens to your baby, you should contact your doctor and/or midwife immediately. If you take LEXAPRO near the end of your pregnancy there may be an increased risk of heavy vaginal bleeding shortly after birth, especially if you have a history of bleeding disorders. Your doctor or midwife should be aware that you are taking LEXAPRO so they can advise you. If used during pregnancy LEXAPRO should never be stopped abruptly. Talk to your doctor if you are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. Do not take LEXAPRO if you are breast- feeding unless you and your doctor have discussed the risks and benefits. It passes into breast milk and therefore there is a possibility that your baby may be affected. LEXAPRO use in children and adolescents Do not give LEXAPRO to a child or adolescent. There is no experience with its use in children or adolescents under 18 years old. LEXAPRO use in the elderly LEXAPRO can be given to elderly patients over 65 years of age with a reduced dose. The effects of LEXAPRO in elderly patients are similar to those in other patients. The recommended maximum dose in elderly patients is 10 mg per day. 3. What if I am taking other medicines? Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any medicines, vitamins, or supplements that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Some medicines may interfere with LEXAPRO and affect how it works. These include • Medicines used to treat nicotine dependence (e.g., bupropion) • Medicines used to treat reflux and ulcers such as, cimetidine, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and lansoprazole • Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), known"}

These medicines may be affected by LEXAPRO or may affect how well it works. You may need to use different amounts of your medicines or take different medicines. Your doctor will advise you. Some combinations of medicines may increase the risk of serious side effects and are potentially life threatening. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure about what medicines, vitamins or supplements you are taking and if these affect LEXAPRO. 4. How do I use LEXAPRO? • How much to take • Your doctor will decide what dose you will receive. • The standard dose for this medicine is 10 mg per day. This may be increased by your doctor to 20 mg per day. The recommended maximum dose in elderly patients is 10 mg per day. It is recommended that patients with liver disease receive an initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks. Your doctor may increase the dose to 10 mg daily. • Your doctor may have prescribed a different dose • • Follow the instructions provided and use LEXAPRO until your doctor tells you to stop. If necessary, you can divide the 10 and 20 mg tablets by firstly placing the tablet on a flat surface with the score facing upwards. The tablets may then be broken by pressing down on each end of the tablet, using both forefingers. The 10 and 20 mg tablets can be divided into equal doses. When to take LEXAPRO • LEXAPRO should be taken as a single dose either in the morning or the evening. Take LEXAPRO with or without food. • • • How to take LEXAPRO • Swallow the tablets whole with a full glass of water Lexapro® 3 • Do not chew LEXAPRO tablets How long to take LEXAPRO Continue to take LEXAPRO even if it takes some time before you feel any improvement in your condition. As with other medicines for the treatment of these conditions it may take a few weeks before you feel any improvement. Individuals will vary greatly in their response to LEXAPRO. Your doctor will check your progress at regular intervals. The duration of treatment may vary for each individual but is usually at least 6 months. In some cases, the doctor may decide that longer treatment is necessary. Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you, even if you begin to feel better. The underlying illness may persist for a long time and if you stop your treatment too soon, your symptoms may return. Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly. If LEXAPRO is stopped suddenly you may experience mild, but usually temporary, symptoms such as dizziness, pins and needles, electric shock sensations, sleep disturbances (vivid dreams, inability to sleep), feeling anxious or agitated, headaches, feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, sweating, tremor (shaking), feeling confused, feeling emotional or irritable, diarrhoea, visual disturbances, or fast or irregular heartbeats. When you have completed your course of treatment, the dose of LEXAPRO is gradually reduced over a couple of weeks rather than stopped abruptly. Your doctor will tell you how to reduce the dosage so that you do not get these unwanted effects. If you forget to use LEXAPRO LEXAPRO should be used regularly at the same time each day. If you miss your dose at the usual time, and remember in less than 12 hours, take it straight away, and then go back to taking it as you would normally. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose you missed. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist. If you have trouble remembering when to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for hints. If you use too much LEXAPRO If you think that you have used too much LEXAPRO, you may need urgent medical attention. Symptoms of an overdose may include dizziness, low blood pressure, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, agitation, tremor (shaking) and rarely convulsions and coma. You should immediately: • • • phone the Poisons Information Centre (by calling 13 11 26), or contact your doctor, or go to the Emergency Department at your nearest hospital. You should do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. 5. What should I know while using LEXAPRO? Things you should do If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking LEXAPRO. Tell any other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who treat you that you are taking this medicine. If you become pregnant while taking LEXAPRO, tell your doctor immediately. Persons taking LEXAPRO may be more likely to think about killing themselves or actually trying to do so, especially when LEXAPRO is first started, or the dose is changed. Tell your doctor immediately if you have thoughts about killing yourself or if you are close to or care for someone using LEXAPRO who talks about or shows signs of killing him or herself. All mentions of suicide or violence must be taken seriously. Occasionally, the symptoms of depression may include thoughts of suicide or self-harm. It is possible that these symptoms continue or get worse until the full antidepressant effect of the medicine becomes apparent. This is more likely to occur if you are a young adult, i.e., 18 to 24 years of age, and you have not used antidepressant medicines before. Patients and care givers should pay attention for any of the following warning signs of suicide-related behaviour while taking LEXAPRO. Tell your doctor immediately, or even go to the nearest hospital for treatment: • • • • thoughts or talk of death or suicide thoughts or talk of self-harm or harm to others any recent attempts of self-harm increase in aggressive behaviour, irritability, or agitation Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as restlessness or difficulty in sitting or standing still. These symptoms can occur during the first weeks of treatment. Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you suddenly experience an episode of mania. Some patients with bipolar disorder (manic depression) may enter into a manic phase. This is characterised by profuse and rapidly changing ideas, exaggerated gaiety, and excessive physical activity. Sometimes you may be unaware of the above-mentioned symptoms and therefore you may find it helpful to ask a friend or relative to help you to observe the possible signs of change in your behaviour. Call your doctor straight away if you: • • • difficulties urinating seizures (fits) yellowing of the skin and the white in the eyes are signs of liver function impairment/hepatitis become pregnant while taking LEXAPRO have thoughts about killing yourself or if you are close to or care for someone using LEXAPRO who talks about or shows signs of killing him or herself • • Lexapro® 4 • • experience symptoms such as restlessness or difficulty in sitting or standing still suddenly experience an episode of mania Remind any doctor, dentist, or pharmacist you visit that you are using LEXAPRO.

At the beginning of treatment, some patients may experience increased anxiety which will disappear during continued treatment. Suddenly stopping LEXAPRO may cause unwanted discontinuation symptoms such as dizziness, sensory disturbances, sleep disturbances, agitation or anxiety tremor, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhoea, palpitations, emotional instability, irritability, visual disturbances, and nausea. Your doctor will tell you when and how LEXAPRO should be discontinued. Your doctor will gradually reduce the amount you are using, usually over a period of one to two weeks, before stopping completely. Driving or using machines Be careful before you drive or use any machines or tools until you know how LEXAPRO affects you. LEXAPRO may cause visual disturbance (such as blurred vision), nausea, fatigue, and dizziness in some people, especially early in the treatment. If you have any of these symptoms, do not drive, operate machinery, or do anything else that could be dangerous. Drinking alcohol Tell your doctor if you drink alcohol. It is not advisable to drink alcohol while you are being treated for depression. Looking after your medicine Follow the instructions in the carton on how to take care of your medicine properly.

Treatment of social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. 4.2 Dose and method of administration Adults Escitalopram is administered as a single oral dose and may be taken with or without food. The oral solution can be mixed with water, orange juice or apple juice. Page 1 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) Turn the bottle completely upside down. If no drops come out, tap the bottle lightly to start the flow. Major depression Usually 2 - 4 weeks are necessary for antidepressant response, The recommended dose is 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet or 10 drops of the 20 mg/mL oral solution) once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg (one 20 mg tablet or 20 drops of the 20 mg/mL oral solution) daily, although the onset of therapeutic effect may be seen earlier. The treatment of a single episode of depression requires treatment over the acute and the medium term. After the symptoms resolve during acute treatment, a period of consolidation of the response is required. Therefore, treatment of a depressive episode should be continued for a minimum of 6 months. Social anxiety disorder The recommended dose is 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet or 10 drops of the 20 mg/mL oral solution) once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg (one 20 mg tablet or 20 drops of the 20 mg/mL oral solution) daily. Social anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course and long-term treatment is therefore warranted to consolidate response and prevent relapse. Generalised anxiety disorder The recommended dose is 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet or 10 drops of the 20 mg/mL oral solution) once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg (one 20 mg tablet or 20 drops of the 20 mg/mL oral solution) daily. Generalised anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course and long-term treatment is therefore warranted to consolidate response and prevent relapse. Obsessive-compulsive disorder The recommended starting dose is 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet or 10 drops of the 20 mg/mL oral solution) once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 20 mg (one 20 mg tablet or 20 drops of the 20 mg/mL oral solution) daily. Long-term treatment has been studied for a maximum of 40 weeks. Patients responding to a 16-week open-label treatment phase were randomised to a 24-week placebo-controlled relapse prevention phase, receiving 10 or 20 mg escitalopram daily. As OCD is a chronic disease, patients should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that they are symptom free. This period may be several months or even longer. Page 2 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) Elderly patients (> 65 years of age) A longer half-life and a decreased clearance have been demonstrated in the elderly. 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet or 10 drops of the 20 mg/mL oral solution) is the recommended maximum maintenance dose in the elderly (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetics properties and Section 4.4 special warning and precautions for use). Children and adolescents (< 18 years of age) Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population. Escitalopram should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age (see Section 4.4 special warning and precautions for use). Reduced hepatic function An initial dose of 5 mg (half a 10 mg tablet or 5 drops of the 20mg/mL oral solution) daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet or 10 drops of the 20 mg/mL oral solution) (see Section 4.4 special warning and precautions for use). Reduced renal function Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. No information is available on the treatment of patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) (see Section 4.4 special warning and precautions for use). Poor metabolisers of CYP2C19 For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg (half a 10 mg tablet or 5 drops of the 20 mg/mL oral solution) daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet or 10 drops of the 20 mg/mL oral solution) (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetics properties and Section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). Discontinuation Significant numbers of discontinuation symptoms may occur with abrupt discontinuation of escitalopram. To minimise discontinuation reactions, tapered discontinuation over a period of at least one to two weeks is recommended. If unacceptable discontinuation symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the dose may be decreased but at a more gradual rate. Page 3 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to citalopram, escitalopram and any excipients in LEXAPRO (see Section 6.1 List of excipients). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors - LEXAPRO should not be used in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), or the reversible MAOI (RIMA), moclobemide, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI, and at least one day after discontinuing treatment with the reversible MAOI (RIMA), moclobemide. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping escitalopram before starting a MAOI or RIMA. Cases of serious reactions, such as potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome (characterised by neuromuscular excitation, altered mental status and autonomic dysfunction) have been reported in patients receiving an SSRI in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), or the reversible MAOI (RIMA), moclobemide,, and in patients who have recently discontinued an SSRI and have been started on a MAOI (see Section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). Pimozide - Concomitant use in patients taking pimozide is contraindicated (see Section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Clinical worsening and suicide risk The risk of suicide attempt is inherent in depression and may persist until significant remission occurs. This risk must be considered in all depressed patients. Patients with depression may experience worsening of their depressive symptoms and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behaviours (suicidality) whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. As improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored for clinical worsening and suicidality, especially at the beginning of a course of treatment, or at the time of dose changes, either increases or decreases. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse or whose emergent suicidality is severe, abrupt in onset, or was not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be alerted about the need to monitor for any worsening of their condition and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation/behaviour or thoughts of harming themselves and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms are present. Patients with comorbid depression associated with other psychiatric disorders being treated with antidepressants should be similarly observed for clinical worsening and suicidality. Patients with a history of suicide-related events, or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal ideation prior to commencement of treatment, are at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. Page 4 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) Pooled analyses of 24 short-term (4 to 16-week), placebo-controlled trials of nine antidepressant medicines (SSRIs and others) in 4,400 children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (16 trials), obsessive-compulsive disorder (4 trials), or other psychiatric disorders (4 trials) have revealed a greater risk of adverse events representing suicidal behaviour or thinking (suicidality) during the first few months of treatment in those receiving antidepressants. The average risk of such events in patients treated with an antidepressant was 4%, compared with 2% of patients given placebo. There was considerable variation in risk among the antidepressants, but there was a tendency towards an increase for almost all antidepressants studied. The risk of suicidality was most consistently observed in the major depressive disorder trials, but there were signals of risk arising from trials in other psychiatric indications (obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder) as well. No suicides occurred in these trials. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk in children and adolescent patients extends to use beyond several months. The nine antidepressant medicines in the pooled analyses included five SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, (buproprion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, venlafaxine). fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) and four non-SSRIs Pooled analyses of short-term studies of antidepressant medications have also shown an increased risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour, known as suicidality, in young adults aged 18 to 24 years during initial treatment (generally the first one to two months). Short- term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond the age of 24 years, and there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 years and older. Symptoms of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, irritability, hostility (aggressiveness), impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adults, adolescents and children being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either worsening of depression and/or emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may be precursors of emerging suicidality. insomnia, Families and caregivers of children and adolescents being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or for any other condition (psychiatric or non-psychiatric) should be informed about the"}

Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either worsening of depression and/or emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may be precursors of emerging suicidality. insomnia, Families and caregivers of children and adolescents being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or for any other condition (psychiatric or non-psychiatric) should be informed about the need to monitor these patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behaviour, and other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms to health care providers immediately. It is particularly important that monitoring be undertaken during the initial few months of antidepressant treatment or at times of dose increase or decrease. Prescriptions for LEXAPRO should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Akathisia/psychomotor restlessness The use of SSRIs/SNRIs has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a subjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability to sit or stand still. This is most likely to occur within the Page 5 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) first few weeks of treatment. In patients who develop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental. Haemorrhage Bleeding abnormalities of the skin and mucous membranes have been reported with the use of SSRIs (including purpura, ecchymoses, haematoma, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding). SSRIs/SNRIs may increase the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (see Sections 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation, 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). LEXAPRO should therefore be used with caution in patients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants, medicinal products known to affect platelet function (e.g. atypical antipsychotics and phenothiazines, most tricyclic antidepressants, acetylsalicylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), ticlopidine and dipyridamole) as well as in patients with a past history of abnormal bleeding or those with predisposing conditions. Pharmacological gastroprotection should be considered for high risk patients. Serotonin syndrome Caution is advisable if escitalopram is used concomitantly with medicinal products with serotonergic effects such as triptans (including sumatriptan), opioids (including tramadol), and tryptophan. Hyponatraemia Probably due to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), hyponatraemia has been reported as a rare adverse reaction with the use of SSRIs. Caution should be exercised in patients at risk, such as the elderly, or patients with cirrhosis, or if used in combination with other medications which may cause hyponatraemia. Seizures The drug should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures. SSRIs should be avoided in patients with unstable epilepsy and patients with controlled epilepsy should be carefully monitored. SSRIs should be discontinued if there is an increase in seizure frequency (see Section 5.3 Preclinical safety data). Diabetes In patients with diabetes, treatment with an SSRI may alter glycaemic control, possibly due to improvement of depressive symptoms. Insulin and/or oral hypoglycaemic dosage may need to be adjusted. Mania A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone can increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk of bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder and depression. Page 6 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) SSRIs should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania/hypomania. SSRIs should be discontinued in any patient entering a manic phase. Sexual Dysfunction reuptake Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). There have been reports of long-lasting sexual dysfunction where the symptoms have continued despite discontinuation of SSRIs/SNRI. (SSRIs)/serotonin norepinephrine inhibitors Angle-closure Glaucoma Antidepressants including LEXAPRO may have an effect on pupil size resulting in mydriasis. This mydriatic effect has the potential to narrow the eye angle resulting in increased intraocular pressure and angle-closure glaucoma, especially in pre-disposed patients. Escitalopram should therefore be used with caution in patients with raised intraocular pressure and in those at risk of angle-closure glaucoma. ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) There is limited published clinical experience of concurrent administration of SSRIs and ECT, therefore caution is advised. Discontinuation Discontinuation symptoms when stopping discontinuation is abrupt. treatment are common, particularly if The risk of discontinuation symptoms may be dependent on several factors including the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. Dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia and electric shock sensations), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhoea, palpitations, emotional instability, irritability, and visual disturbances are the most commonly reported reactions. Generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, in some patients they may be severe in intensity. They usually occur within the first few days of discontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have inadvertently missed a dose. Generally, these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 weeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2 - 3 months or more). It is therefore advised that escitalopram should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of several weeks or months, according to the patient’s needs (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Cardiac disease Escitalopram has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Like other SSRIs, Page 7 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) escitalopram causes a small decrease in heart rate. Consequently, caution should be observed when escitalopram is initiated in patients with pre-existing slow heart rate. Use in hepatic impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment, clearance of escitalopram was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased. The dose of escitalopram in hepatically impaired patients should therefore be reduced (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetics and Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration).). Use in renal impairment Escitalopram is extensively metabolised and excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. At present no information is available for the treatment of patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) and escitalopram should be used with caution in such patients (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Use in the elderly (> 65 years) Escitalopram AUC and half-life were increased in subjects  65 years of age compared to younger subjects in a single-dose and a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study. The dose of escitalopram in elderly patients should therefore be reduced (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Paediatric use (children and adolescents < 18 years) The efficacy and safety of escitalopram has not been established in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age. Consequently, escitalopram should not be used in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age. Effects on laboratory tests See Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects) 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions MAOIs Co-administration with MAO inhibitors may cause serotonin syndrome (see Section 4.3 Contraindications). Reversible, non-selective MAO-inhibitor (linezolid) The antibiotic linezolid is a reversible non-selective MAO-inhibitor and should not be given to patients treated with escitalopram. If the combination proves necessary, it should be given with minimum dosages and under close clinical monitoring (see Section 4.3). Irreversible, selective MAO-B inhibitor (selegiline) In combination with selegiline (irreversible MAO-B inhibitor), caution is required due to the risk of developing serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome Page 8 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) Development of serotonin syndrome may occur in association with treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, particularly when given in combination with MAOIs or other serotonergic agents. Symptoms and signs of serotonin syndrome include rapid onset of neuromuscular excitation (hyperreflexia, tremor), altered mental status (confusion, agitation, hypomania) and autonomic dysfunction (diaphoresis, diarrhoea, fever, shivering and rapidly fluctuating vital signs). Treatment with escitalopram should be discontinued if such events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment initiated. incoordination, myoclonus, Pimozide Co-administration of a single dose of pimozide 2 mg to subjects treated with racemic citalopram 40 mg/day for 11 days caused an increase in AUC and Cmax of pimozide, although not consistently throughout the study. The co-administration of pimozide and citalopram resulted in a mean increase in the QTc interval of approximately 10 msec. Due to the interaction with citalopram noted at a low dose of pimozide, concomitant administration of escitalopram and pimozide is contraindicated (see Section 4.3 Contraindications). Serotonergic drugs Co-administration with serotonergic drugs e.g. opioids (including tramadol), triptans (including sumatriptan) may lead to an enhancement of serotonergic effects. Similarly, Hypericum perforatum (St John’s Wort) should be avoided as adverse interactions have been reported with a range of drugs including antidepressants. Lithium and tryptophan There have been reports of enhanced effects when SSRIs have been given with lithium or tryptophan and therefore concomitant use of SSRIs with these drugs should be undertaken with caution. Medicines affecting the central nervous system Given the primary CNS effects of escitalopram, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Medicines lowering the seizure threshold SSRIs can lower the seizure threshold. Caution is advised when concomitantly using other medicinal products capable of lowering the seizure threshold (e.g. antidepressants (tricyclics, SSRIs), neuroleptics thioxanthenes, butyrophenones), (phenothiazines, mefloquine, bupropion and tramadol). Hepatic enzymes Escitalopram has a low potential for clinically significant drug interactions. In vitro studies have shown that the biotransformation of escitalopram to its demethylated metabolites depends on three parallel pathways (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19, 3A4 and 2D6). Escitalopram is a very weak inhibitor of isoenzyme CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2E1, and 3A4, and a weak inhibitor of 2D6. Effects of other drugs on escitalopram in vivo Page 9 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) The pharmacokinetics of escitalopram was not changed by co-administration with ritonavir (CYP3A4 inhibitor). Furthermore, co-administration with ketoconazole (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) did not change the pharmacokinetics of racemic"}

Effects of other drugs on escitalopram in vivo Page 9 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) The pharmacokinetics of escitalopram was not changed by co-administration with ritonavir (CYP3A4 inhibitor). Furthermore, co-administration with ketoconazole (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) did not change the pharmacokinetics of racemic citalopram. Co-administration of escitalopram with omeprazole (a CYP2C19 inhibitor) resulted in a moderate (approximately 50%) increase in plasma concentrations of escitalopram and a small but statistically significant increase (31%) in the terminal half-life of escitalopram (see also Poor metabolisers of CYP2C19 under Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Co-administration of escitalopram with cimetidine (moderately potent general enzyme inhibitor) resulted the plasma concentrations of escitalopram. in a moderate (approximately 70%) increase in Thus, caution should be exercised at the upper end of the dose range of escitalopram when used concomitantly with CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole, esomeprazole, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, lansoprazole, fluconazole, and ticlopidine) or cimetidine. A reduction in the dose of escitalopram may be necessary based on clinical judgement (see also Poor metabolisers of CYP2C19 under Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Effects of escitalopram on other drugs in vivo Escitalopram is an inhibitor of the enzyme CYP2D6. Caution is recommended when escitalopram is co-administered with medicinal products that are mainly metabolised by this enzyme, and that have a narrow therapeutic index, e.g. flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol (when used in cardiac failure), or some CNS acting medicinal products that are mainly metabolised by CYP2D6, e.g. antidepressants such as desipramine, clomipramine and nortriptyline or antipsychotics like risperidone, thioridazine and haloperidol. Dosage adjustment may be warranted. Co-administration with desipramine (a CYP2D6 substrate) resulted in a twofold increase in plasma levels of desipramine. Therefore, caution is advised when escitalopram and desipramine are co-administered. A similar increase in plasma levels of desipramine, after administration of imipramine, was seen when given together with racemic citalopram. Co-administration with metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate) resulted in a twofold increase in the plasma levels of metoprolol. However, the combination had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir (CYP3A4 inhibitor) was not changed by co-administration with escitalopram. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic racemic citalopram have demonstrated no clinically important interactions with carbamazepine (CYP3A4 substrate), triazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 substrate), levomepromazine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), lithium and digoxin. interaction studies with Haemorrhage Page 10 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in haemostasis. There is an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of abnormal bleeding. Concurrent use of an NSAID, aspirin or warfarin potentiates this risk. Thus, patients should be cautioned about using such medicines concurrently with LEXAPRO. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy should receive careful coagulation monitoring when escitalopram is started or stopped (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Alcohol The combination of SSRIs and alcohol is not advisable. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Effects on fertility No fertility studies were performed with escitalopram. However, other nonclinical studies suggest that the effects of escitalopram can be directly predicted from those of the citalopram racemate. In rats, female fertility was unaffected by oral treatment with citalopram doses which achieved plasma drug concentrations slightly in excess of those expected in humans, but effects on male rat fertility have not been tested with adequate oral doses. Animal data have shown that some SSRIs induce a reduction of fertility index and pregnancy index, reduction in number in implantation and abnormal sperm. No animal data related to this aspect are available for escitalopram. Animal data have shown that some SSRIs may affect sperm quality. Use in pregnancy Category C. Limited clinical data are available regarding exposure to escitalopram during pregnancy. Newborns should be observed if maternal use of LEXAPRO continues into the later stages of pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. If escitalopram is used until or shortly before birth, discontinuation effects in the newborn are possible. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided during pregnancy (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration, 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Newborns exposed to LEXAPRO, other SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), or SNRIs (Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors), late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalisation, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnoea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycaemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, lethargy, constant crying, somnolence and difficulty sleeping. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, Page 11 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. In the majority of cases the complications begin immediately or soon (< 24 hours) after delivery. Epidemiological studies have shown that the use of SSRI’s (including escitalopram) in pregnancy, particularly use in late pregnancy, was associated with an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). The risk of PPHN among infants born to women who used SSRIs late in pregnancy was estimated to be 4 to 5 times higher than the rate of 1 to 2 per 1000 pregnancies observed in the general population. Oral treatment of rats with escitalopram during organogenesis at maternotoxic doses led to increased post-implantation loss and reduced foetal weight at systemic exposure levels (based on AUC) ca. 11-fold that anticipated clinically, with no effects seen at 6-fold. No teratogenicity was evident in this study at relative systemic exposure levels of ca. 15 (based on AUC). There were no peri/postnatal effects of escitalopram following oral dosing of pregnant rats (conception through to weaning) at systemic exposure levels (based on AUC) ca. 2-fold that anticipated clinically. However, the number of stillbirths was increased and the size, weight and postnatal survival of offspring were decreased at a relative systemic exposure level ca. 5. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and only after careful consideration of the risk/benefit. Observational data indicate an increased risk (less than 2-fold) of postpartum haemorrhage following SSRI/SNRI exposure within the month prior to birth (see Sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Use in lactation It is expected that escitalopram, like citalopram, will be excreted into human breast milk. Studies in nursing mothers have shown that the mean combined dose of citalopram and demethylcitalopram transmitted to infants via breast milk (expressed as a percentage of the weight-adjusted maternal dose) is 4.4 - 5.1% (below the notional 10% level of concern). Plasma concentrations of these drugs in infants were very low or absent and there were no adverse effects. Whilst the citalopram data support the safety of use of escitalopram in breast-feeding women, the decision to breast-feed should always be made as an individual risk/benefit analysis. impair 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Escitalopram does not function and psychomotor performance. However, adverse effects of Lexapro include visual disturbances (such as blurred vision) and dizziness which could affect the ability to drive or use machines (see Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)). As with other psychoactive drugs, patients should be cautioned about their ability to drive a car and operate machinery. intellectual Page 12 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects) Adverse reactions observed with escitalopram are in general mild and transient. They are most frequent during the first one or two weeks of treatment and usually decrease in intensity and frequency with continued treatment and generally do not lead to a cessation of therapy. Data from short-term placebo-controlled studies are presented below. The safety data from the long-term studies showed a similar profile.

These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with escitalopram treatment. ECG Changes Cases of QT prolongation have been reported during the post-marketing period with both citalopram and escitalopram. Citalopram can cause dose-dependent QT interval prolongation. In an ECG study, the observed change from baseline QTC (Fridericia correction) was 7.5 msec at the 20mg/day dose and 16.7 msec at the 60mg/day dose of citalopram. The effect of escitalopram on the QT interval was similarly studied at doses of 10mg/day and 30mg/day. The change from baseline QTc (Fridericia correction) was 4.3 msec at the 10mg/day dose and 10.7 msec with the above recommended dose of 30mg/day. The QTc interval prolongation observed with 60mg citalopram exceeded that observed with 30mg escitalopram. It is probable that the R-enantiomer and its metabolites in racemic citalopram contribute to these effects. Mydriasis and angle-closure glaucoma Cases of mydriasis and angle-closure glaucoma have been reported in the post-marketing period (see Section 4.4 Special warning and precautions for use) Weight Changes Patients treated with escitalopram in controlled trials did not differ from placebo-treated patients with regard to clinically important change in body weight. Page 15 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) Laboratory Changes In clinical studies, there were no signals of clinically important changes in either various serum chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis parameters associated with escitalopram treatment compared to placebo or in the incidence of patients meeting the criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. For abnormal laboratory changes registered as either uncommon events or serious adverse events from ongoing trials and observed during (but not necessarily caused by) treatment with Lexapro, please see Other Events Observed during the Premarketing Evaluation of Lexapro under Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects).

Class effect Epidemiological studies, mainly conducted in patients 50 years of age and older, show an increased risk of bone fractures in patients receiving SSRIs and TCAs. The mechanism leading to this risk is unknown. Postpartum haemorrhage has been reported for the therapeutic class of SSRIs/SNRIs (see Sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation). Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment Discontinuation of SSRIs/SNRIs to discontinuation symptoms. Dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia and electric shock sensations), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhoea, palpitations, emotional instability, irritability, and visual disturbances are the most commonly reported reactions. Generally these events are mild to moderate and are (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads Page 20 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) self-limiting, however, in some patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. It is therefore advised that when escitalopram treatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration and 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Reporting suspected adverse effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions at www.tga.gov.au/reporting-problems. 4.9 Overdose In general, the main therapy for all overdoses is supportive and symptomatic care. Toxicity Clinical data on escitalopram overdose are limited and many cases involve concomitant overdoses of other drugs. In the majority of cases mild or no symptoms have been reported. Fatal cases of escitalopram overdose have rarely been reported with escitalopram alone; the majority of cases have involved overdose with concomitant medications. Doses between 400 and 800 mg of escitalopram alone have been taken without any severe symptoms. Symptoms Symptoms seen in reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmia and ECG changes (including QT prolongation), and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions. Treatment There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. The use of activated charcoal should be considered. Activated charcoal may reduce absorption of the drug if given within one or two hours after ingestion. In patients who are not fully conscious or have impaired gag reflex, consideration should be given to administering activated charcoal via a nasogastric tube, once the airway is protected. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures.

The antidepressant action of escitalopram is presumably linked to the potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibitory effect on the reuptake of 5-HT from the synaptic cleft. Escitalopram is a highly selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI). On the basis of in vitro studies, escitalopram had no, or minimal effect on noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake. In contrast to many tricyclic antidepressants and some of the SSRIs, escitalopram has no or very low affinity for a series of receptors including 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, DA D1 and DA D2 receptors, 1-, 2-, -adrenoceptors, histamine H1, muscarine cholinergic, benzodiazepine, and opioid receptors. A series of functional in vitro tests in isolated organs as well as functional in vivo tests have confirmed the lack of receptor affinity. Escitalopram has high affinity for the primary binding site and an allosteric modulating effect on the serotonin transporter. Allosteric modulation of the serotonin transporter enhances binding of escitalopram to the primary binding site, resulting in more complete serotonin reuptake inhibition. Escitalopram is the S-enantiomer of the racemate (citalopram) and is the enantiomer to which the therapeutic activity is attributed. Pharmacological studies have shown that the R-enantiomer is not inert but counteracts the serotonin-enhancing properties of the S-enantiomer in citalopram. In healthy volunteers and in patients, escitalopram did not cause clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECGs, or laboratory parameters. S-demethylcitalopram, the main plasma metabolite, attains about 30% of parent compound levels after oral dosing and is about 5-fold less potent at inhibiting 5-HT reuptake than escitalopram in vitro. It is therefore unlikely to contribute significantly to the overall antidepressant effect. Clinical trials LEXAPRO should not be used for the treatment of major depression, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years since the safety and efficacy in this population have not been established. Major Depression Page 22 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) LEXAPRO should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. Two fixed-dose studies and one flexible-dose study have shown escitalopram in the dose range 10 - 20 mg/day to be more efficacious than placebo in the treatment of depression. All three studies were randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies. Two of the studies included an active reference (citalopram). All three studies consisted of a 1-week single-blind placebo lead-in period followed by an 8-week double-blind treatment period. Patients were required to have depression with a minimum score of 22 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at both the screening and baseline visits. The MADRS consists of 10 items that measure core symptoms of depression, such as sadness, tension, pessimism and suicidal thoughts. Each item is rated on a scale of 0 (no abnormality) to 6 (severe). The populations studied were therefore defined as suffering from moderate to severe depression (mean MADRS score 29). A total of 591 patients received escitalopram in these studies. All three studies showed escitalopram to be statistically significantly superior to placebo on the ITT LOCF analysis of the mean change from baseline in the MADRS total score (p≤0.01). The magnitude of the difference between escitalopram and placebo in the MADRS change score ranged from 2.7 to 4.6 (mean of these values: 3.6). The magnitude of the difference for citalopram ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 (mean of these values: 2.0). The magnitude of the difference is larger with escitalopram than with citalopram. Escitalopram demonstrated a significant early difference compared to placebo from week 2 onwards on the MADRS (week 1 in observed cases analysis). Likewise, the Clinical Global Impression–Improvement items (CGI-I) differed significantly from placebo from week 1 onwards. These early differences were not seen with racemic citalopram. In the study with two parallel escitalopram dose groups, analysis of subgroups of patients showed a trend towards greater improvement in patients with severe major depressive disorder (HAM-D > 25) receiving 20 mg/day as compared to 10 mg/day. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) consists of 17 to 24 items reflecting core symptoms of depression. Each item is scored on a 3, 4, or 5 point scale with 0 reflecting no symptoms and higher scores reflecting increasing symptom severity. In a fourth flexible-dose study with a similar design, the primary analysis did not distinguish a significant drug/placebo difference for either escitalopram or citalopram over 8 weeks on the MADRS change score in the LOCF dataset. However, on the basis of the OC analysis, both escitalopram and citalopram were significantly better than placebo (p≤0.05; difference between escitalopram and placebo: 2.9). Escitalopram demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of anxiety symptoms associated with depression. In the three positive double-blind placebo-controlled studies escitalopram was shown to be effective compared to placebo on the MADRS anxiety items; inner tension and sleep disturbances. Furthermore, in the one study where the Hamilton Anxiety Scale Page 23 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) (HAM-A) and the anxiety factor of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D scale) were used, results have shown that escitalopram was significantly better than placebo. In a relapse prevention trial, 274 patients meeting (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder, who had responded during an initial 8-week open-label treatment phase with escitalopram 10 or 20 mg/day, were randomised to continuation of escitalopram at the same dose, or to placebo, for up to 36 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open-label phase was defined as a decrease of the MADRS total score to ≤ 12. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of the MADRS total score to ≥ 22, or discontinuation due to insufficient clinical response. Patients receiving continued escitalopram experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the subsequent 36 weeks compared to those receiving placebo (26% vs. 40%; hazard ratio=0.56, p=0.013). Further evidence of long-term efficacy is provided in a 6-month study which compared escitalopram 10 mg/day to citalopram 20 mg/day over a 6-month treatment period. Analysis of the primary endpoint (the development of the MADRS total scores over 24 weeks) demonstrated escitalopram to be at least as efficacious as citalopram in the long-term treatment of depression. Secondary analyses showed that, while both treatments resulted in numerical improvements in ratings in the MADRS, HAM-A and the CGI, escitalopram was statistically"}

Additional supportive evidence of the sustained efficacy of escitalopram treatment is demonstrated in an open-label 12-month study. The efficacy of escitalopram was maintained throughout the study, as measured by the MADRS total score and CGI-S score. Patients showed continued improvement, with total MADRS scores falling from 14.2 at baseline to 5.8 at last assessment, and CGI-scores falling from 2.7 at baseline to 1.6 at last assessment. A study in the elderly did not provide conclusive efficacy results for escitalopram, as the reference drug (fluoxetine) failed to differentiate from placebo. However, safety data from this study showed escitalopram to be well tolerated. Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) LEXAPRO should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. The efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder was demonstrated in three 8-week placebo-controlled flexible-dose studies (10 to 20 mg per day) and one 12-week fixed-dose, active-reference (paroxetine 20 mg/day), study (5, 10 and 20 mg per day). In the four studies, the mean HAM-A total scores at baseline ranged from 22.1 to 27.7 and the CGI-S scores were 4.2 or higher, indicating significant GAD symptomatology. Page 24 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) In all three placebo-controlled, flexible-dose studies, escitalopram was significantly better than placebo at endpoint on the primary efficacy measure (mean change from baseline to endpoint in HAM-A total score), and the results were supported by secondary efficacy measures. In the fixed-dose study, over a 12-week period, escitalopram in doses of 10 and 20 mg/day was statistically significantly more effective than placebo on the primary measure of efficacy, with an effect size at least as high as that of the reference treatment paroxetine. The 5 mg dose of escitalopram was numerically, but not statistically significantly, superior to placebo. 10 mg escitalopram was statistically significantly superior to the reference treatment paroxetine (LOCF) based on the HAM-A and CGI-I.

The separation from placebo was first observed at week 1 and continued through to the end of the study (week 8). The treatment difference to placebo at week 8 was –2.3 in favour of escitalopram (p0.01). The results of the primary analysis (pooled data) were supported by secondary LOCF analyses (pooled data), where escitalopram was statistically significantly superior to Page 25 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) placebo on the HAM-A psychic anxiety subscale score (p0.001), the HAM-A item 1 (anxious mood) score (p0.001), and the HAM-A item 2 (tension) score (p0.01). Escitalopram was also more effective than placebo on the CGI-S score (p0.01) and on the CGI-I score at week 8 (p0.001). The results on the HAD anxiety subscale, the HAM-A somatic subscale, the HAM-D anxiety scale, the Covi Anxiety Scale (OC), and the QoL (OC) also showed superior efficacy of escitalopram relative to placebo at week 8 (p0.05). The long-term efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of GAD is based on the results from the double-blind active comparator study, an open-label extension study and a double- blind, randomised, placebo-controlled relapse prevention study. The active comparator study demonstrated numerically superior efficacy of escitalopram over paroxetine both on the primary efficacy measure (mean change from baseline in HAM-A total score) and on the secondary efficacy measures (mean change from baseline in HAM-A psychic anxiety, CGI-S, QoL, HAM-A somatic anxiety, HAM-A item 1 (anxious mood), HAM-A item 2 (tension), HAM-D anxiety and Covi scores, and mean CGI-I score) at week 24. For all but one (QoL) of the efficacy measures, a further improvement was seen from week 8 to week 24. In the primary efficacy analysis, the extra improvement in mean HAM-A total score over the last 16 weeks of treatment was 2.3 points for escitalopram compared with 1.6 points for paroxetine. Further evidence of long-term efficacy is provided by an open-label extension study, which showed a beneficial effect of continued treatment with escitalopram. In this study, escitalopram treatment was associated with additional improvement beyond the response observed during the initial 8 weeks of treatment in the lead-in studies. The mean change in HAM-A total score from baseline (final visit of the lead-in study) to week 24 (LOCF) was -3.8, with greater improvement observed in patients who were switched from placebo in the lead-in study to escitalopram in the extension study (4.9 points versus 2.7 points for those previously treated with escitalopram). Similar positive results were seen in the analyses of secondary efficacy measures. Escitalopram 20 mg/day significantly reduced the risk of relapse in a 24- to 76-week randomised continuation study in 373 patients who had responded during the initial 12- week open-label treatment. Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) LEXAPRO should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. The efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of SAD was demonstrated in three placebo- controlled clinical studies. A short-term, flexible-dose (10 to 20 mg/day) study, a long-term, fixed-dose (5, 10, and 20 mg/day), active-reference (paroxetine 20 mg/day) study, and a relapse prevention study. Approximately two-thirds of patients in the studies were markedly or severely ill (score of 5 or 6 on the CGI-S) and one-third were moderately ill (score of 4 or less on the CGI-S). The mean baseline LSAS total score ranged from 92 to 96 in the three studies. Page 26 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) In the short-term, flexible-dose study, over a 12-week period, escitalopram was statistically significantly better than placebo on the primary, and almost all the secondary measures of efficacy (see Table 2). In the placebo-controlled, active-reference study, escitalopram was effective both in the short- and in the long-term (see Table 2), with an effect size at least as high as that of the reference treatment paroxetine (escitalopram 20 mg/day was significantly superior to the reference treatment paroxetine 20 mg/day from week 16 and onwards (OC)). Thus, continued treatment with escitalopram improves treatment response. At week 24 of the study, all three doses of escitalopram also produced significant improvements in the LSAS subscale scores for fear/anxiety and avoidance, the CGI-I score (except for the 10 mg dose of escitalopram), the CGI-S score, and the SDS subscale scores for work, social life, and family life.

The analyses showed a further increase both in the proportion of responders and in the proportion of remitters from week 12 to week 24, especially in the escitalopram 20 mg group. At week 24, a statistically significantly greater proportion of responders and remitters were seen in all three escitalopram dose groups (except for the proportion of responders in the 10 mg group) than in the placebo group (p0.01) (see Tables 3 and 4).

Furthermore, patients treated with escitalopram had fewer protocol-defined relapses than those treated with placebo. In addition, patients treated with escitalopram showed a further improvement in mean LSAS total score during the double- blind period, while patients treated with placebo showed deterioration. Escitalopram was also statistically significantly superior to placebo at week 24 on all the secondary efficacy measures in this study: the LSAS total score, the LSAS subscale scores for fear/anxiety and avoidance, the CGI-S score, and the SDS subscale scores for work, social life, and family"}

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) LEXAPRO should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. Page 28 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) Efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of OCD was investigated in two clinical trials, a 24-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study (with efficacy assessments at week 12 and week 24) and a 16 + 24-week placebo-controlled relapse prevention study. Patients included in these studies were male and female outpatients aged 18 – 65 years with a diagnosis of OCD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) criteria and a pre-defined minimum score of 20 on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Patients had actual baseline Y-BOCS scores of approx. 27, indicating significant OCD symptomatology. A structured clinical interview, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), was used to assist in the diagnosis and to exclude relevant psychiatric comorbidities. In order to avoid the confounding variable of significant concomitant depression, patients with more than mild depressive symptoms, i.e. a score of 22 or more on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), were excluded. To ensure a relatively homogenous population with OCD, patients currently diagnosed with any other psychiatric disorders as per Axis I of DSM-IV- TR or any clinically significant unstable medical illness were also excluded. Results at week 12 of the 24-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study are shown in Tables 5 and 6. In the short-term (12 weeks), 20 mg/day escitalopram separated from placebo on the Y-BOCS total score.

Both escitalopram 10 mg/day and escitalopram 20 mg/day were significantly more efficacious than placebo on the Y-BOCS subscale of obsessions as well as on the NIMH-OCS total score, CGI-I score and CGI-S score.

This 24-week relapse prevention study was preceded by a 16-week open-label period with patients initially receiving escitalopram 10 mg/day. In case of lack of efficacy (as judged by the investigator), the dose could be increased to a maximum of 20 mg/day. If dose-limiting adverse effects occurred, it was permissible to decrease the dose to 10 mg/day. Thus, the dose of escitalopram was flexible at 10 - 20 mg/day from week 2 to 12. Subsequently, the dose was fixed at the dose received at the end of week 12 until week 16 to allow stabilisation of the patient on this dose. Responders to treatment Page 30 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) were defined as patients with a decrease in Y-BOCS total score from baseline by  25% at week 16, and remitters were defined as Y-BOCS ≤ 10. See Table 10 for responder and remitter rates at the end of the 16-week open-label phase.

Absorption is expected to be almost complete and independent of food intake (mean Tmax is 4 hours after multiple dosing). While the absolute bioavailability of escitalopram has not been studied, it is unlikely to differ significantly from that of racemic citalopram (about 80%). Distribution The apparent volume of distribution (Vd,/F) after oral administration is about 12 to 26 L/kg. The binding of escitalopram to human plasma proteins is independent of drug plasma levels and averages 55%. Page 31 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) Metabolism Escitalopram is metabolised in the liver to the demethylated and didemethylated metabolites. Alternatively, the nitrogen may be oxidised to form the N-oxide metabolite. Both parent and metabolites are partly excreted as glucuronides. Unchanged escitalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. After multiple dosing the mean concentrations of the demethyl and didemethyl metabolites are usually 28 - 31% and < 5% of the escitalopram concentration, respectively. Biotransformation of escitalopram to the demethylated metabolite is mediated by a combination of CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Excretion The elimination half-life (t½) after multiple dosing is about 30 hours and the oral plasma clearance (Cloral) is about 0.6 L/min. Escitalopram and major metabolites are, like racemic citalopram, assumed to be eliminated both by the hepatic (metabolic) and the renal routes with the major part of the dose excreted as metabolites in urine. Approximately 8.0% of escitalopram is eliminated unchanged in urine and 9.6% as the S-demethylcitalopram metabolite based on 20 mg escitalopram data. Hepatic clearance is mainly by the P450 enzyme system. The pharmacokinetics of escitalopram are linear over the clinical dosage range. Steady state plasma levels are achieved in about 1 week. Average steady state concentrations of 50 nmol/L (range 20 to 125 nmol/L) are achieved at a daily dose of 10 mg. Special Populations Reduced hepatic function In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Criteria A and B), the half-life of escitalopram was about twice as long and the exposure was about 60% higher than in subjects with normal liver function (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Reduced renal function While there is no specific data, the use of escitalopram in reduced renal function may be extrapolated from that of racemic citalopram. Escitalopram is expected to be eliminated more slowly in patients with mild to moderate reduction of renal function with no major impact on the escitalopram concentrations in serum. At present no information is available for the treatment of patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). Elderly patients (> 65 years) Escitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects > 65 years of age were compared to younger subjects in a single-dose and a multiple-dose study. Escitalopram AUC and half-life were increased by approximately 50% in elderly subjects, and Cmax was unchanged. 10 mg is the recommended dose for elderly patients. Page 32 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) Gender In a multiple-dose study of escitalopram (10 mg/day for 3 weeks) in 18 male (9 elderly and 9 young) and 18 female (9 elderly and 9 young) subjects, there were no differences in AUC, Cmax and half-life between the male and female subjects. No adjustment of dosage on the basis of gender is needed. Polymorphism It has been observed that poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19 have twice as high a plasma concentration of escitalopram as extensive metabolisers. No significant change"}

No adjustment of dosage on the basis of gender is needed. Polymorphism It has been observed that poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19 have twice as high a plasma concentration of escitalopram as extensive metabolisers. No significant change in exposure was observed in poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2D6 (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). 5.3 Preclinical safety data High doses of escitalopram, which resulted in plasma Cmax for escitalopram and metabolites at least 8-fold greater than anticipated clinically, have been associated with convulsions, ECG abnormalities and cardiovascular changes in experimental animals. Of the cardiovascular changes, cardiotoxicity (including congestive heart failure) was observed in comparative toxicological studies in rats following oral escitalopram or citalopram administration for 4 to 13 weeks and appears to correlate with peak plasma concentrations although its exact mechanism is not clear. Clinical experiences with citalopram, and the clinical trial experience with escitalopram, do not indicate that these findings have a clinical correlate. Genotoxicity No genotoxicity studies were performed with escitalopram. However, other nonclinical studies suggest that the effects of escitalopram can be directly predicted from those of the citalopram racemate. Carcinogenicity No carcinogenicity studies were performed with escitalopram. However, other nonclinical studies suggest that the effects of escitalopram can be directly predicted from those of the citalopram racemate. Citalopram did not show any carcinogenic activity in long-term oral studies using mice and rats at doses up to 240 and 80 mg/kg/day, respectively. In assays of genotoxic activity, citalopram showed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity. 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 List of excipients Lexapro tablets 10mg and 20mg contain the following excipients: microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal anhydrous silica, purified talc, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, opadry OY-S28849 PI (4748) (contains: hypromellose, macrogol 400, titanium dioxide) Page 33 of 35 LEXAPRO® (escitalopram oxalate) Lexapro 20mg/ml oral solution contains the following excipients: propyl gallate, citric acid, ethanol, sodium hydroxide and purified water. 6.2 Incompatibilities Incompatibilities were either not assessed or not identified as part of the registration of this medicine. 6.3 Shelf life In Australia, information on the shelf life can be found on the public summary of the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).

Jardiance® Active ingredient: empagliflozin Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) This leaflet provides important information about using Jardiance. You should also speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you would like further information or if you have any concerns or questions about using Jardiance. Where to find information in this leaflet: 1. Why am I using Jardiance? 2. What should I know before I use Jardiance? 3. What if I am taking other medicines? 4. 5. What should I know while using Jardiance? 6. 7. Are there any side effects? Product details How do I use Jardiance? 1. Why am I using Jardiance? Jardiance contains the active ingredient empagliflozin. It belongs to a group of medicines called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. It works by blocking a protein in the kidneys called SGLT2 and removes blood sugar via the urine. As a result, the levels of sugar in your blood are reduced. Jardiance also reduces the amount of salt reabsorbed by your kidneys, which helps to reduce excess strain on the heart. Jardiance may also help to protect your kidneys from further damage caused by high blood sugar levels and excess strain on the heart. Jardiance is used to lower blood sugar levels in adults and children aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus when diet and exercise is not enough to control your blood sugar levels. It may be used either: alone as a single medicine, or in combination with other anti-diabetic medicines such as: metformin, sulfonylurea medicines (such as glimepiride and glibenclamide), pioglitazone, insulin, or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor medicines (such as linagliptin or sitagliptin). In adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, Jardiance can also be used to reduce your risk of dying from your cardiovascular disease. Jardiance is also used with other medicines to treat heart failure and to slow the progression of kidney disease in adult patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Your doctor may have prescribed this medicine for another reason. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why Jardiance has been prescribed for you. Type 2 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus (also known as non-insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus) develops when your body doesn’t make enough insulin or the insulin your body makes does not work as well as it should. Insulin helps to control your blood sugar levels, and when there is not enough insulin or it does not work well, the amount of sugar in your blood can start to build up. Too much sugar in the blood can cause damage to the body’s cells, and can lead to problems with your eyes, heart, kidneys, and circulation. Heart Failure In heart failure, the heart does not work as well as it should. This means the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The most common symptoms of heart failure are breathlessness, fatigue, tiredness and ankle swelling. Kidney disease Some conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure can lead to kidney problems. These problems develop slowly over several years. Good control of your blood sugar and blood pressure are important in keeping your kidneys healthy, but may not always prevent kidney damage from occurring. 2.

Vortioxetine is not indicated for paediatric use. 4.2 Dose and method of administration The starting and recommended dose of BRINTELLIX in adults less than 65 years of age is 10 mg once daily, taken with or without food. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily or reduced to a minimum of 5 mg daily. An antidepressant effect of BRINTELLIX based on the primary efficacy measure was generally observed starting at week 2. If the depressive symptoms resolve, treatment for at least 6 months is recommended for consolidation of the antidepressive response. Physicians should periodically re-evaluate the usefulness of the drug for individual patients. Treatment discontinuation Patients being treated with BRINTELLIX can abruptly stop taking BRINTELLIX without 1 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) the need for a gradual reduction in dose. Missed Dose If a dose is missed, the next dose should be taken at the usual time. Patients should not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Special Populations Elderly patients The recommended starting dose is 5 mg vortioxetine once daily and should always be used as the starting dose in patients ≥ 65 years of age. Caution is advised when treating patients ≥ 65 years of age with doses higher than 10 mg vortioxetine once daily. Patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment or for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, as with any medicine, caution should be exercised when treating patients with severe renal insufficiency (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties). Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment; however, caution should be exercised when prescribing to these patients (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties). Cytochrome P450 inhibitors Depending on individual patient response, a lower dose of BRINTELLIX may be considered if strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. bupropion) are added to BRINTELLIX treatment. Cytochrome P450 inducers Depending on individual patient response, a dose adjustment of BRINTELLIX may be considered if a broad cytochrome P450 inducer (e.g. rifampicin) is added to BRINTELLIX treatment. Paediatric population Vortioxetine is not recommended in paediatric patients (under 18 years of age) with major depressive disorder (MDD) as efficacy has not been demonstrated. The safety of vortioxetine in paediatric patients with MDD is described in Sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects). 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to vortioxetine or any of the tablet excipients (see Section 2 Qualitative and quantitative composition). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) BRINTELLIX should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI. BRINTELLIX should be discontinued for at least 14 days before starting treatment with an MAOI (see Section 4.4 Special 2 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) warnings and precautions for use and Section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Clinical worsening and Suicide Risk The risk of suicide attempt is inherent in depression and may persist until significant remission occurs. This risk must be considered in all depressed patients. Patients with depression may experience worsening of their depressive symptoms and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behaviours (suicidality) whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. As improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored for clinical worsening and suicidality, especially at the beginning of a course of treatment, or at the time of dose changes, either increases or decreases. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse or whose emergent suicidality is severe, abrupt in onset, or was not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be alerted about the need to monitor for any worsening of their condition and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation/behaviour or thoughts of harming themselves and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms are present. Patients with comorbid depression associated with other psychiatric disorders being treated with antidepressants should be similarly observed for clinical worsening and suicidality. Patients with a history of suicide-related events, or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal ideation prior to commencement of treatment, are at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. Pooled analyses of 24 short-term (4 to 16-week), placebo-controlled studies of nine antidepressant medicines (SSRIs and others) in 4,400 children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (16 studies), obsessive-compulsive disorder (4 studies), or other psychiatric disorders (4 studies) have revealed a greater risk of adverse events representing suicidal behaviour or thinking (suicidality) during the first few months of treatment in those receiving antidepressants. The average risk of such events in patients treated with an antidepressant was 4%, compared with 2% of patients given placebo. There was considerable variation in risk among the antidepressants, but there was a tendency towards an increase for almost all antidepressants studied. The risk of suicidality was most consistently observed in the major depressive disorder studies, but there were signals of risk arising from studies in other psychiatric indications (obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder) as well. No suicides occurred in these studies. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk in children and adolescent patients extends to use beyond several months. The nine antidepressant medicines in the pooled analyses included five SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) and four non-SSRIs (bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, venlafaxine). 3 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) Pooled analyses of short-term studies of antidepressant medications have also shown an increased risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour, known as suicidality, in young adults aged 18 to 24 years during initial treatment (generally the first one to two months). Short- term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond the age of 24 years, and there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 years and older. Symptoms of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility (aggressiveness), impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adults, adolescents and children being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either worsening of depression and/or emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may be precursors of emerging suicidality. Families and caregivers of children and adolescents being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or for any other condition (psychiatric or non-psychiatric) should be informed about the need to monitor these patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behaviour, and other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms to health care providers immediately. It is particularly important that monitoring be undertaken during the initial few months of antidepressant treatment or at times of dose increase or decrease. Prescriptions for BRINTELLIX should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Serotonin syndrome/Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Development of serotonin syndrome /NMS, potentially life-threatening conditions, may occur in association with treatment with serotonergic antidepressants, including vortioxetine. The risk of serotonin syndrome or NMS is increased with concomitant use of serotonergic active substances (including opioids and triptans), medicinal products that impair the metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), antipsychotics, and other dopamine antagonists. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome or NMS (see Section 4.3 Contraindications and Section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). Symptoms and signs of serotonin syndrome/NMS include rapid onset of neuromuscular excitation (hyperreflexia, incoordination, myoclonus, tremor), altered mental status (confusion, agitation, hypomania) and autonomic dysfunction (diaphoresis, diarrhoea, fever, shivering and rapidly fluctuating vital signs) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting). Treatment with BRINTELLIX should be discontinued if such events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment initiated. Activation of Mania/Hypomania As with all drugs effective in the treatment of depression, BRINTELLIX should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania/hypomania and should be discontinued in any patient entering a manic phase. A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed that treating such an episode with 4 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) an antidepressant alone can increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk of bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder and depression. Aggression/agitation Patients treated with antidepressants, including vortioxetine, may also experience feelings of aggression, anger, agitation and irritability. Patient’s condition and disease status should be closely monitored. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be alerted to seek medical advice, if aggressive/agitated behaviour emerges or aggravates. Seizures Seizures are a potential risk with antidepressant drugs. Therefore, as with other antidepressants, BRINTELLIX should be introduced cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or in patients with unstable epilepsy (see Section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). Treatment should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures or where there is an increase in seizure frequency. Haemorrhage As with any antidepressant with serotonergic effect, bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses,"}

Seizures Seizures are a potential risk with antidepressant drugs. Therefore, as with other antidepressants, BRINTELLIX should be introduced cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or in patients with unstable epilepsy (see Section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). Treatment should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures or where there is an increase in seizure frequency. Haemorrhage As with any antidepressant with serotonergic effect, bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal or gynaecological haemorrhage may occur. Antidepressants with serotonergic effects, including vortioxetine, may increase the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. Caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/or medicinal products known to affect platelet function (e.g. atypical antipsychotics and phenothiazines, most tricyclic antidepressants, NSAIDs or aspirin) (see Section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions), and in patients with known bleeding tendencies. Hyponatraemia Hyponatraemia, probably due to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), has been reported rarely with the use of antidepressants with serotonergic effect. Caution should be exercised in patients at risk, such as elderly, cirrhotic patients or patients concomitantly treated with medications known to cause hyponatraemia. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) The safety and efficacy of the concurrent use of BRINTELLIX and ECT have not been studied, and therefore, caution is advisable. Sexual Dysfunction Use of serotonergic antidepressants, including Brintellix, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. In male patients, serotonergic antidepressant use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. 5 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of Brintellix and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment. Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness BRINTELLIX has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease, patients with psychiatric co-morbidities, neurological comorbidities, unstable medical illness or stroke. Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the product’s premarketing testing. Use in hepatic impairment Pharmacokinetic data in subjects with hepatic impairment are available (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ). No dose adjustment is needed based on hepatic function, however, caution should be exercised. Use in renal impairment Limited data are available for patients with severe renal impairment. Caution should therefore be exercised (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Angle-closure Glaucoma Antidepressants including BRINTELLIX may have an effect on pupil size resulting in mydriasis. This mydriatic effect has the potential to narrow the eye angle resulting in increased intraocular pressure and angle-closure glaucoma, especially in pre-disposed patients. BRINTELLIX should therefore be used with caution in patients with raised intraocular pressure and in those at risk of angle-closure glaucoma. Use in the elderly The recommended starting dose is 5 mg vortioxetine once daily in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Paediatric use BRINTELLIX is not recommended for the treatment of depression in paediatric patients (under 18 years of age) since the efficacy of BRINTELLIX has not been established in this age group. In general, the adverse reaction profile of vortioxetine in children and adolescents was similar to that seen for adults except for a higher incidence of abdominal pain-related events, and a higher incidence of suicidal ideation in adolescents specifically, compared to adults. In clinical studies among children and adolescents treated with other antidepressants, suicide-related behaviour (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) were more frequently observed compared to those treated with placebo. 6 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) Effects on laboratory tests Interference with urine drug screens: There have been reports of false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone in patients who have taken vortioxetine Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of positive urine drug screen results, and confirmation by an alternative analytical technique (e.g., chromatographic methods) should be considered. 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions BRINTELLIX is extensively metabolised in the liver primarily through oxidation and subsequent glucuronic acid conjugation. In vitro studies indicate that the cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, CYP2C8 and CYP2B6 are involved in the metabolism of vortioxetine (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties). Potential for other medicinal products to affect BRINTELLIX Irreversible non-selective MAOIs Due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, BRINTELLIX is contraindicated in any combination with irreversible non-selective MAOIs. For patients changing treatment regimens, BRINTELLIX must not be initiated for at least 14 days after discontinuation of treatment with an irreversible non-selective MAOI. BRINTELLIX must be discontinued for at least 14 days before starting treatment with an irreversible non-selective MAOI (see Section 4.3 Contraindications). Reversible, selective MAO-A inhibitor (moclobemide) The combination of BRINTELLIX with a reversible and selective MAO-A inhibitor (RIMA), such as moclobemide, is not recommended. A latent period of at least 24 hours after the last dose of moclobemide should be introduced before changing treatment to BRINTELLIX. Moclobemide should not be used for at least 14 days after discontinuation of BRINTELLIX (see Section 4.3 Contraindications). Reversible, non-selective MAOI (linezolid) The antibiotic linezolid is a weak reversible and non-selective MAOI and should not be given to patients treated with BRINTELLIX. Linezolid should not be used for at least 14 days after discontinuation of BRINTELLIX (see Section 4.3 Contraindications). Irreversible, selective MAO-B inhibitor (selegiline, rasagiline) Although a lower risk of serotonin syndrome is expected with selective MAO-B inhibitors as compared with MAO-A inhibitors, the combination of BRINTELLIX with selegiline or rasagiline should be exercised with caution. MAO-B inhibitors should not be used for at least 14 days after discontinuation of BRINTELLIX (see Section 4.3 Contraindications). Serotonergic medicinal products Co-administration with medicinal products that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, lithium, St. John's Wort, dextromethorphan, opioids (including tramadol) and triptans (including sumatriptan) may 7 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) lead to serotonin syndrome (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). St. John’s Wort Concomitant use of antidepressants with serotonergic effect and herbal remedies containing St. John´s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may result in an increased incidence of adverse reactions including serotonin syndrome (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Medicinal products lowering the seizure threshold Antidepressants with serotonergic effect can lower the seizure threshold. Caution is advised when concomitantly using other medicinal products capable of lowering the seizure threshold (e.g.antidepressants (tricyclics, SSRIs, SNRIs), neuroleptics (phenothiazines, thioxanthenes and butyrophenones), mefloquine, bupropion and tramadol) (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) There is no clinical experience of concurrent administration of BRINTELLIX and ECT, therefore caution is advisable. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors The exposure to vortioxetine increased 2.3-fold for AUC when BRINTELLIX 10 mg/day was co-administered with bupropion (a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor) 150 mg b.i.d. for 14 days in 44 healthy subjects. The co-administration resulted in a higher incidence of adverse events when bupropion was added to BRINTELLIX than when BRINTELLIX was added to bupropion. Depending on individual patient response, a lower dose of BRINTELLIX may be considered if strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. bupropion) are added to BRINTELLIX treatment (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). When BRINTELLIX was co-administered following 6 days of ketoconazole 400 mg/day (a CYP3A4/5 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor) in 17 healthy subjects, a 1.3-fold increase in vortioxetine AUC was observed. No dose adjustment is needed. When BRINTELLIX was co-administered following 6 days of fluconazole 200 mg/day (a CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 inhibitor) in 16 healthy subjects, a 1.5-fold increase in AUC was observed. No dose adjustment is needed. Cytochrome P450 inducers When a single dose of 20 mg BRINTELLIX was co-administered following 10 days of rifampicin 600 mg/day (a broad inducer of CYP isozymes) in 14 healthy subjects, a 72% decrease in AUC of BRINTELLIX was observed. Depending on individual patient response, a dose adjustment may be considered (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Potential for BRINTELLIX to affect other medicinal products Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents No significant effects, relative to placebo, were observed in INR, prothrombin or plasma R-/S-warfarin values following co-administration of 10 mg/day vortioxetine for 14 days with stable doses of warfarin in 52 healthy subjects. Also, no significant inhibitory effect, 8 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) relative to placebo, on platelet aggregation was observed when aspirin 150 mg/day was co- administered following 14 days of BRINTELLIX 10 mg/day administration in 28 healthy subjects. However, as for other serotonergic agents, caution should be exercised when vortioxetine is combined with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding attributable to a pharmacodynamic interaction (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Lithium, tryptophan No clinically relevant effect was observed during steady-state lithium exposure following co- administration with BRINTELLIX 10 mg/day for 14 days in 16 healthy subjects. However, there have been reports of enhanced effects when antidepressants with serotonergic effect have been given together with lithium or tryptophan, therefore concomitant use of vortioxetine with these medicinal products should be undertaken with caution. Alcohol Overall no impairment, relative to placebo, in cognitive function using a battery of neuropsychological tests was observed for BRINTELLIX single doses of 20 and 40 mg following co-administration with a single dose of ethanol 0.6 g/kg in 55 healthy subjects. Diazepam No significant impairment, relative to placebo, in cognitive function using a battery of neuropsychological tests was observed for vortioxetine following co-administration of BRINTELLIX 10 mg/day with a single 10 mg dose of diazepam in 32 healthy subjects. Oral contraceptives No significant effects, relative to placebo, were observed in the levels of sex hormones following co-administration of BRINTELLIX 10 mg/day with a combined oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 μg/ levonorgestrel 150 μg) in 25 healthy women for 21 days."}

Oral contraceptives No significant effects, relative to placebo, were observed in the levels of sex hormones following co-administration of BRINTELLIX 10 mg/day with a combined oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 μg/ levonorgestrel 150 μg) in 25 healthy women for 21 days. Cytochrome P450 substrates In vitro, vortioxetine did not show any relevant potential for inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 isozymes. No inhibitory effect of vortioxetine (10 mg/day for 14 days) was observed in healthy subjects for the cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2C19 (omeprazole, diazepam), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP3A4/5 (ethinyl estradiol), or CYP2B6 (bupropion). In a drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects, no inhibitory effect of vortioxetine 10 mg/day for 14 days was observed for CYP2C9 (tolbutamide), CYP1A2 (caffeine), or CYP3A4/5 (midazolam), while CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan) was affected, the decrease in dextromethorphan levels was not considered clinically meaningful. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Effects on fertility Vortioxetine given prior to and during mating, and in early pregnancy at oral doses achieving exposures 20 times the maximum recommended human dose had no effect on 9 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) rat fertility, mating performance, or on sperm morphology and motility. Use in pregnancy – Pregnancy Category B3 BRINTELLIX should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit outweighs the risk. There are no or limited data (fewer than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of vortioxetine in pregnant women. In studies in which vortioxetine was administered to rats and rabbits during organogenesis, reduced foetal weight and delayed ossification was observed. In rats, these findings were observed at a vortioxetine exposure (plasma AUC) 30-fold or greater than that achieved at the maximum recommended human dose. No increased incidence of foetal malformations was noted. In rabbits, doses associated with delayed ossification, although resulting in vortioxetine exposures (plasma AUC) comparable to that at the maximum recommended human dose, were maternotoxic. In rabbits, an increased incidence of runts was observed at a vortioxetine exposure about 3-fold that at the maximum recommended human dose. A pre- and postnatal study in rats showed reduced pup survival during the lactation period at exposures (plasma AUC) 8-fold or greater than those achieved at the maximum recommended human dose. The following symptoms may occur in newborns exposed to serotonergic agents in later stages of pregnancy: respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnoea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycaemia, hypertonia, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, lethargy, constant crying, somnolence and difficulty sleeping. These symptoms could be due to either discontinuation effects or excess serotonergic activity. In a majority of instances, such complications begin immediately or soon (<24 hours) after delivery. Epidemiological data suggest that the use of SSRIs in pregnancy, particularly in late pregnancy, may increase the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN). Although no studies have investigated the association of PPHN with vortioxetine treatment, this potential risk cannot be ruled out taking into account the related mechanism of action (increase in serotonin concentrations). Observational data have provided evidence of an increased risk (less than 2-fold) of postpartum haemorrhage following exposure to an SSRI or SNRI within the month prior to birth. Although no studies have investigated an association between vortioxetine treatment and postpartum haemorrhage, there is a potential risk, taking into account the related mechanism of action (See Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Use in lactation In nonclinical studies vortioxetine-related material was excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is expected that vortioxetine will be excreted into human milk. Consequently, breast- feeding is not recommended during treatment. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No significant impairment, relative to placebo, in driving performance, cognitive function or other psychomotor skills, was observed when 21 healthy subjects were administered single and multiple doses of 10 mg/day BRINTELLIX. However, as with any 10 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) psychoactive drug, patients should exercise caution when driving or operating hazardous machinery especially when starting treatment with BRINTELLIX or when changing the dose. 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects) Adverse events information for BRINTELLIX was collected in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in a clinical programme that included more than 6,700 patients, of whom 3,460 were treated with BRINTELLIX (5 to 20 mg/day) in short- term placebo- controlled (up to 8 weeks) studies. During clinical studies, all treatment groups were comparable with respect to gender, age and race. The mean age of patients was 46 years (18 to 88 years). Of these patients, approximately 67% were females and 33% were males. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Short Term Studies in Adults and Elderly Adverse events that occurred in BRINTELLIX treated patients in the course of the MDD short-term, placebo-controlled studies with an incidence ≥10% were headache and nausea. The incidence of headache was 13.2% with BRINTELLIX and 12.9% with placebo, which suggests that this is a non-specific symptom related to the underlying condition or treatment administration. The incidence of nausea was higher with BRINTELLIX (24.1%) compared to the lower rates of nausea in the placebo group (8.1%). The majority of cases of nausea in the MDD Short-Term studies were transient and mild to moderate and did not generally lead to cessation of therapy. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as nausea, occurred more frequently in women than men. In the MDD short-term studies, discontinuation due to adverse events was more common with BRINTELLIX (6.0%) compared with placebo (4.0%). Nausea was the most common reason for patients discontinuing due to adverse events. Table 1 enumerates the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in the short-term placebo-controlled studies. Events included are those occurring in 1% or more of patients treated with BRINTELLIX (5 to 20 mg/day), and for which the incidence in patients treated with vortioxetine was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients.

In the MDD 6 to 8-week placebo-controlled clinical studies with BRINTELLIX, voluntarily reported adverse reactions related to sexual dysfunction were captured as individual event terms. These event terms have been aggregated and the incidence was 1.6% for BRINTELLIX (5-20 mg; n=3460) compared to 0.9% for placebo (n=1968). Because voluntarily reported adverse sexual reactions are known to be underreported, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them, the Arizona Sexual 12 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) Experiences Scale (ASEX), a validated measure designed to identify sexual side effects, was used prospectively in seven placebo-controlled trials. The ASEX scale includes five questions that pertain to the following aspects of sexual function: 1) sex drive, 2) ease of arousal, 3) ability to achieve erection (men) or lubrication (women), 4) ease of reaching orgasm, and 5) orgasm satisfaction. The presence or absence of sexual dysfunction among patients entering clinical studies was based on their ASEX scores. For patients without sexual dysfunction at baseline (approximately 1/3 of the population across all treatment groups in each study), Table 2 shows the incidence of patients that developed treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction (TESD) when treated with BRINTELLIX or placebo in any fixed dose group. Physicians should routinely inquire about possible sexual side effects.

Vortioxetine 10-20 mg/day had statistically significantly less TESD than escitalopram 10-20 mg/day as measured by change in the CSFQ-14 total score (2.2 points, p=0.013) at week 8. The proportion of responders was not significantly different in the vortioxetine group (162 (74.7%)) compared with the escitalopram group (137 (66.2%)) at week 8 (OR 1.5 p=0.057). The antidepressant effect was maintained in both treatment groups. See Figure 1. 13 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) Figure 1. Change from Baseline in CSFQ-14 Total Score by Study Visit (Week) In a 5-week, double-blind, placebo- and paroxetine-controlled study in healthy subjects with normal sexual functioning, without the confounding effect of depression, vortioxetine 10 mg/day (2.74 points, p=0.009) was statistically significantly better than paroxetine 20 mg/day as measured by change in the CSFQ-14 total score, whereas vortioxetine 20 mg/day was not (1.05 points, p=0.303). Neither vortioxetine 10 mg/day nor 20 mg/day were significantly worse than placebo. See Figure 2. Figure 2. Change from Baseline in CSFQ-14 Total Score by Study Visit (Week) e n i l e s a B m o r f e g n a h C i g n n e s r o W Study Visit (Week) Insomnia Although insomnia is common in patients with depression, either as part of the disease or as an adverse effect of antidepressants, for vortioxetine, the reporting of adverse events related to insomnia and poor-quality sleep is low and similar to placebo. Side-effects related to insomnia or poor-quality sleep may affect treatment adherence. Table 3 shows the percentage of reported adverse reactions related to insomnia or poor sleep quality in the short-term studies in patients with MDD. 14 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) TABLE 3 INCIDENCE OF INSOMNIA RELATED SIDE EFFECTS IN A POOL OF 12 PLACEBO-CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES FOR MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER Percentage of Patients Reporting Adverse Event Insomnia Initial insomnia Sleep disorder Middle insomnia Poor quality sleep Dyssomnia Terminal insomnia BRINTELLIX (5-20 mg) (n =3460) 2.7 0.5 0.2 0.3 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 Placebo (n = 1968) 2.5 0.3 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.1 0.0 Discontinuation symptoms BRINTELLIX was not associated with an increase in signs or symptoms consistent with withdrawal effects. Weight BRINTELLIX was not associated with weight gain (<1 kg) in either short or long-term clinical studies. Cardiovascular BRINTELLIX was not associated with clinically significant effects on vital signs or the ECG. In a randomised, placebo- and positive-controlled, parallel group, thorough QTc study in 340 healthy subjects, treatment with BRINTELLIX 10 or 40 mg/day for 14 days did not prolong the QTc interval. Adverse Events during Treatment up to 64 weeks The adverse event profile of BRINTELLIX in a longer-term study in patients with MDD consisting of a 24-64 week placebo-controlled relapse observation phase in remitters after a preceding 12-week acute treatment phase was similar to that observed in short-term studies. During long-term, double-blind treatment the overall incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) was 62% for BRINTELLIX and 64% for placebo. Table 4 enumerates the incidence of TEAEs that occurred in 204 depressed patients who received BRINTELLIX at 5 or 10 mg/day for 24 to 64 weeks. Events included are those occurring in 2% or more of patients treated with BRINTELLIX, and for which the incidence in patients treated with BRINTELLIX was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients. 15 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) TABLE 4 INCIDENCE OF ADVERSE EVENTS ≥2% FOR DOUBLE-BLIND PERIOD OF MDD RELAPSE PREVENTION STUDY Percentage of Patients Reporting Placebo (n = 192) Adverse Event Nausea Influenza Gastroenteritis Abdominal pain upper Insomnia Dry mouth Back pain Asthenia BRINTELLIX 5 or 10 mg (n =204) 8.8 6.9 5.4 4.9 2.5 2.0 2.0 2.0 3.1 5.2 3.1 1.0 1.6 0.0 0.5 0.5 Less Common Clinical Study Adverse Drug Reactions The events listed below present treatment emergent adverse events occurring in less than 1% of the patients treated with BRINTELLIX (5 to 20 mg/day) in 12 short-term placebo- controlled studies in depressed patients (n=3460).

BRINTELLIX is not indicated for use in patients below the age of 18 years. Reporting suspected adverse effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions at www.tga.gov.au/reporting-problems. 17 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) 4.9 Overdose In clinical studies no patients ingested more than 75 mg vortioxetine on a single occasion. The clinical studies included subjects who were administered 40 to 75 mg. Ingestion of vortioxetine in this dose range caused an aggravation of the following adverse events: nausea, postural dizziness, diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort, generalized pruritus, somnolence and flushing. Post-marketing experience mainly concerns vortioxetine overdoses of up to 80 mg. In the majority of cases, no symptoms or mild symptoms were reported. The most frequently reported symptoms were nausea and vomiting. There is limited experience with vortioxetine overdoses above 80 mg. Following dosages several fold higher than the therapeutic dose range, events of seizure and serotonin syndrome have been reported. Management of overdose should consist of treatment of clinical symptoms and relevant monitoring. Medical follow-up in a specialised environment is recommended. For information on the management of overdose, contact the Poison Information Centre (Tel: 13 11 26 for Australia and Tel: 0800 764 766 for New Zealand). 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Mechanism of action The mechanism of action of vortioxetine is thought to be related to its multimodal activity, which is a combination of two pharmacological modes of action: direct modulation of receptor activity and inhibition of the serotonin transporter. In vitro studies indicate that vortioxetine is a 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist and inhibitor of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT). The precise contribution of the individual targets to the observed pharmacodynamic profile remains unclear. However, data from nonclinical serotonergic receptor and transporter occupancy studies coupled with neuronal firing and microdialysis studies suggest that the targets interact in a complex fashion, leading to modulation of neurotransmission in several systems, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, histamine, acetylcholine, gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate systems within the forebrain. These multimodal pharmacological actions are thought to be responsible for the antidepressant effects of vortioxetine. Pharmacodynamics Vortioxetine shows antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects in some animal models (e.g. forced swim, conditioned fear-induced vocalisation, social interaction, marble burying and novelty-induced suppression of feeding tests). It is also effective in the models tested that are predictive of an enhanced effect on cognitive function (learning and memory) (e.g. contextual fear conditioning test and restoration of performance deficits induced by 5-HT depletion in the novel object recognition and Y-maze spontaneous alternation tests). In addition, in a sexual behavioural study in male rats at an oral dose achieving a vortioxetine 18 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) plasma exposure similar to that at the maximum recommended human dose, vortioxetine did not induce sexual dysfunction. In humans, two positron emission tomography (PET) studies have been performed using 5-HTT ligands ([11C]-MADAM or [11C]-DASB) to quantify the 5-HT transporter occupancy in the brain across different dose levels. The mean 5-HT transporter occupancy in the specific regions of interest was approximately 50% at 5 mg/day, 65% at 10 mg/day and increased to above 80% at 20 mg/day. Vortioxetine has shown clinical antidepressant effects at 5-HT transporter occupancies as low as 50%. Clinical trials Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Short Term Studies in Adults including Elderly The efficacy and safety of BRINTELLIX have been studied in a clinical program that included more than 6,700 patients, of whom more than 3,700 were treated with BRINTELLIX in short-term (≤12 weeks) studies in major depressive disorder (MDD). Twelve double-blind, placebo controlled, 6/8-week, fixed-dose studies have been conducted to investigate the short-term efficacy of BRINTELLIX in MDD both in adults and in the elderly. The efficacy"}

Clinical trials Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Short Term Studies in Adults including Elderly The efficacy and safety of BRINTELLIX have been studied in a clinical program that included more than 6,700 patients, of whom more than 3,700 were treated with BRINTELLIX in short-term (≤12 weeks) studies in major depressive disorder (MDD). Twelve double-blind, placebo controlled, 6/8-week, fixed-dose studies have been conducted to investigate the short-term efficacy of BRINTELLIX in MDD both in adults and in the elderly. The efficacy of BRINTELLIX was demonstrated across 9 of the 12 studies, as measured by improvement in the Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) or Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 24-item (HAM-D24) total score and supported by clinical relevance as demonstrated by the proportions of responders and remitters and the improvement in Clinical Global Impression – Global Improvement (CGI-I) score. In each of the 8 short-term studies in adults that demonstrated statistical superiority the effect seen with BRINTELLIX ranged from 2.4 to 7.2 points difference to placebo in MADRS total score at week 6/8 mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. The antidepressant effect in the individual studies was supported by the meta-analysis using MMRM of the mean change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 6/8 in the short- term, placebo- controlled studies in adults. In the meta-analysis, the overall mean difference to placebo across the studies was statistically significant: -2.3 points (p = 0.007), -3.6 points (p <0.001), and -4.6 points (p <0.001) for the 5, 10, and 20 mg/day doses, respectively; the 15 mg/day dose did not separate statistically from placebo in the meta-analysis, but the mean difference to placebo was -2.6 points. The efficacy of BRINTELLIX increased with increasing dose. The efficacy of BRINTELLIX is supported by the pooled responder analysis, in which the proportion of responders ranged from 46% to 49% for vortioxetine versus 34% for placebo (p <0.01; NRI analysis). Furthermore BRINTELLIX, in the dose range of 5-20 mg/day, demonstrated efficacy on the broad range of depressive symptoms (assessed by improvement in all MADRS single– item scores). In a 12-week, double-blind, flexible-dose, comparative study in patients with moderate to severe depression who switched antidepressant treatment after an inadequate response to one therapy with SSRI/SNRI for the current episode, BRINTELLIX 10-20 mg/day was statistically significantly better (p=0.002) than agomelatine 25-50 mg/day as measured by improvement in the MADRS total score. 19 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) In a short-term study, in adults, BRINTELLIX (10 and 20 mg/day) was superior to placebo (p<0.001) on the primary outcome measure, a composite cognition score consisting of two neuropsychological tests: a neuropsychological test of executive function, processing speed, and attention, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and a test of learning and memory, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). MDD Long term relapse prevention The maintenance of antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated in a relapse-prevention study. Patients in remission after an initial 12-week open-label treatment period with BRINTELLIX were randomised to BRINTELLIX 5 or 10 mg/day or placebo and observed for relapse during a double-blind period of at least 24 weeks (24 to 64 weeks). A total of 639 patients were treated with open-label BRINTELLIX. Four hundred (62.6%) patients achieved remission and entered the double-blind treatment phase. Remission was defined as MADRS total score ≤10. Relapse was defined as a MADRS total score ≥22 or lack of efficacy, as judged by the investigator. BRINTELLIX was superior (p=0.004) to placebo on the primary outcome measure, the time to relapse of MDD with a hazard ratio of 2.0; that is, the risk of relapse was two times higher in the placebo group than in the BRINTELLIX group. Relapse rates during the first 24 weeks of the double-blind period were 13.2% in the combined 5 mg and 10 mg BRINTELLIX groups and 26.0% in the placebo group. See Figure 3. Figure 3. Time to Relapse within First 24 Weeks of Double-blind Period (FAS) Other Clinical Efficacy Results Elderly In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week, fixed-dose study in elderly (≥ 65 years) depressed patients, BRINTELLIX 5 mg/day was statistically significantly superior to placebo (p=0.001) as measured by improvement in the HAM-D24 and MADRS total scores. Patients with Severe Depression or High Levels of Anxiety Symptoms In severely depressed patients (baseline MADRS total score ≥30) and in depressed patients 20 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) with a high level of anxiety symptoms (baseline HAM-A total score ≥20) BRINTELLIX also demonstrated efficacy in the short-term studies in adults (effect size ranged from 2.8 to 7.3 and from 3.6 to 7.3 points difference, respectively, to placebo in MADRS total score at week 6/8 (MMRM analysis)). In the dedicated study in elderly BRINTELLIX was also effective in these patients. The maintenance of antidepressant efficacy was also demonstrated in this patient population in the long-term relapse prevention study. The Comparison of Vortioxetine and Escitalopram on Antidepressant Effects In an 8-week, double-blind, flexible-dose, comparative study (n=424) of vortioxetine versus escitalopram in patients treated for at least 6 weeks with an SSRI (citalopram, paroxetine, or sertraline), with a low level of depressive symptoms (baseline CGI-S ≤ 3) and TESD induced by the prior SSRI treatment, patients in both treatment groups had similar maintenance of antidepressant effect. Paediatric population BRINTELLIX is not indicated for use in patients below the age of 18 years. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption The maximal plasma vortioxetine concentration (Cmax) after multiple oral doses is reached within 7 to 8 hours post-dose (Tmax). Steady state mean Cmax values were 9, 18, and 33 ng/mL following doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/day. The absolute bioavailability is 75%. No effect of food on the pharmacokinetics was observed. Distribution The mean volume of distribution (Vss) from population PK analysis in healthy volunteers is 2,600 L, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. Vortioxetine is highly bound to plasma proteins (98 to 99%) and the binding appears to be independent of vortioxetine plasma concentrations. Metabolism Vortioxetine is extensively metabolised in the liver, primarily through oxidation and subsequent glucuronic acid conjugation. In vitro studies indicate that the cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, CYP2C8 and CYP2B6 are involved in the metabolism of vortioxetine. No inhibitory or inducing effect of vortioxetine was observed in vitro for the CYP isozymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4/5 nor was an inhibitory effect observed in vitro for CYP2D6 or CYP2El. Vortioxetine is a poor P-gp substrate and inhibitor. The major metabolite of vortioxetine (Lu AA34443) is pharmacologically inactive. Excretion The mean elimination half-life and oral clearance from population PK analysis in healthy volunteers are 66 hours and 33 L/h, respectively. Approximately ⅔ of the inactive vortioxetine metabolites are excreted in the urine and 21 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) approximately ⅓ in the faeces. Only negligible amounts of vortioxetine are excreted in the faeces. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved in approximately 2 weeks. Linearity/non-linearity The pharmacokinetics is linear and time independent in the dose range studied. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) There is a curve-linear concentration-response relationship between the plasma concentrations of vortioxetine after single and multiple doses of 2.5 to 60 mg/day and the occupancy of the 5-HT transporter in the brain, as measured using PET. Special Populations Elderly Patients In elderly healthy subjects (aged ≥65 years; n=20), the exposure to vortioxetine increased up to 27% (Cmax and AUC) compared to young healthy control subjects (aged ≤45 years) after multiple doses of 10 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 5 mg vortioxetine once daily in patients ≥65 years of age (See Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Renal impairment Following a single dose of 10 mg vortioxetine, renal impairment estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (mild, moderate, or severe; n=8 per group) caused modest exposure increases (up to 11%), compared to healthy matched controls. In patients with end-stage renal disease, only a small fraction of vortioxetine was lost during the dialysis process (AUC and Cmax were 13% and 27% lower; n=8) following a single 10 mg dose of vortioxetine. No dose adjustment is needed on the basis of renal function, however, caution should be exercised (See Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ). Hepatic impairment The pharmacokinetics in subjects (N = 6-8) with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Criteria A, B, or C, respectively) were compared to healthy volunteers. After a single dose of 10 or 5 mg, the changes in AUC were less than 10% in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Following a single dose of 5 mg, AUC was 44% higher and Cmax was 24% lower in those with severe hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is needed on the basis of hepatic function, however caution should be exercised (See Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ). CYP2D6 poor metabolisers The plasma concentration of vortioxetine was approximately two times higher in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers than in extensive metabolisers. No dose adjustment is needed (See Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Gender Systemic exposures are similar between males and females of comparable body size and no dose adjustment is needed. 22 of 25 BRINTELLIX® (vortioxetine hydrobromide) Race No dose adjustment on the basis of race or ethnicity is needed based on the population PK study. Race or ethnicity had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Genotoxicity Vortioxetine was not genotoxic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay and a chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes in vitro and an in vivo micronucleus test. Carcinogenicity Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with vortioxetine in mice and rats at doses which achieved exposures (plasma Cmax) well in excess of that at the maximum recommended human dose. Although there were some positive findings (increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas in rats and in male mice, and of haemangiomas in the mesenteric lymph node and of histiocytic sarcomas in male rats, and of polypoid adenomas in the rectum of female rats). None of these findings were considered to pose a risk of carcinogenicity in humans. 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 List of excipients Refer to Section 2 Qualitative and quantitative composition. 6.2 Incompatibilities Refer to Section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other"}

Add-on combination therapy In combination with other glucose–lowering medicinal products including insulin, when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Clinical trials). JARDIANCE PI0145-21 1 Prevention of cardiovascular death JARDIANCE is indicated in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Clinical trials). To prevent cardiovascular deaths, JARDIANCE should be used in conjunction with other measures to reduce cardiovascular risk in line with the current standard of care. Heart failure JARDIANCE is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure independent of left ventricular ejection fraction, as an adjunct to standard of care therapy (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Clinical trials). Chronic kidney disease JARDIANCE is indicated to reduce the risk of kidney disease progression in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD Stages 2 and 3A with urine ACR ≥30 mg/g, or CKD Stages 3B, 4 and 5 irrespective of urine ACR). 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION Type 2 diabetes mellitus The recommended starting dose of JARDIANCE is 10 mg once daily. In patients tolerating empagliflozin 10 mg once daily who have an eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and requiring additional glycaemic control, the dose can be increased to 25 mg once daily. Combination therapy When JARDIANCE is used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see Sections 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions and 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Heart failure The recommended dose of JARDIANCE Pharmacodynamic Properties - Clinical Trials). is 10 mg once daily (see Section 5.1 Chronic kidney disease The recommended dose of JARDIANCE Pharmacodynamic Properties - Clinical Trials). is 10 mg once daily (see Section 5.1 JARDIANCE can be taken with or without food. Patients with renal impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of empagliflozin and periodically thereafter. Empagliflozin 10 mg can be used regardless of renal function. However, due to limited experience, it is not recommended to initiate treatment with JARDIANCE in patients with an eGFR <20mL/min/1.73m2. Glycaemic efficacy of empagliflozin is dependent on renal function and likely absent in patients with severe renal impairment. If eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 the recommended dose of empagliflozin is limited to 10 mg and additional glucose lowering treatment should be considered if needed (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). JARDIANCE PI0145-21 2 Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Elderly Patients Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age. Therapeutic experience in patients aged 85 years and older is limited. Initiation of empagliflozin therapy in this population is not recommended (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Patients aged 75 years and older should be prescribed with caution (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Heart Failure No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age. Patients aged 75 years and older should be prescribed with caution (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Paediatric population Type 2 diabetes mellitus The recommended starting dose of JARDIANCE is 10 mg once daily. In patients tolerating empagliflozin 10 mg once daily and requiring additional glycaemic control, the dose can be increased to 25 mg once daily (see general information above in Section 4.2 Dose and Method of Administration). No data are available for children with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m² and children below 10 years of age. Heart failure Safety and effectiveness of JARDIANCE for the treatment of heart failure in children under 18 years of age have not been established. Chronic kidney disease Safety and effectiveness of JARDIANCE for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in children under 18 years of age have not been established. 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to empagliflozin or any of the excipients in JARDIANCE. In case of rare hereditary conditions that may be incompatible with an excipient of the product, the use of the product is contraindicated. The JARDIANCE 10 mg tablet contains 162.5 mg of lactose monohydrate and the JARDIANCE 25 mg tablet contains 113 mg of lactose monohydrate per maximum recommended daily dose. Patients with the rare hereditary conditions of galactose intolerance e.g. galactosaemia should not take this medicine. 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE General JARDIANCE should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes (see Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications). Ketoacidosis Cases of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalisation, have been reported in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus treated JARDIANCE PI0145-21 3 with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking empagliflozin. Cases of ketoacidosis have also been reported in patients without diabetes mellitus who were treated with JARDIANCE. Patients treated with JARDIANCE who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels as ketoacidosis associated with JARDIANCE may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 13.8 mmol/L. Signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis may include excessive thirst, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalised malaise, and shortness of breath. If ketoacidosis is suspected, JARDIANCE should be discontinued, the patient should be evaluated and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis generally requires insulin, fluid, potassium and carbohydrate replacement. Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may be prolonged after discontinuation of JARDIANCE in some patients, i.e. it may last longer than expected from 5 plasma half-lives of empagliflozin (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous ketoacidosis while on SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved. Before initiating JARDIANCE, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis. insulin pump Factors that predispose patients to ketoacidosis include a low carbohydrate diet, dehydration, acute illness, surgery (see below), a previous ketoacidosis, insulin deficiency from any cause (including failure, history of pancreatitis, or pancreatic surgery), malnourishment/reduced caloric intake or increased insulin requirements due to infections, and alcohol abuse. JARDIANCE should be used with caution in these patients. When reducing the insulin dose in patients requiring insulin, caution should be taken (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing JARDIANCE in clinical situations known to predispose ketoacidosis. In these situations, consider monitoring of ketones, even if JARDIANCE treatment has been interrupted. Surgery Treatment with JARDIANCE should be ceased prior to major surgery. An increase in other glucose lowering agents may be required during this time. Patients scheduled for non-urgent surgery who have not ceased empagliflozin should be assessed and consideration should be given to postponing the procedure. Treatment with JARDIANCE may be restarted once the patient's condition has stabilised and oral intake is normal. Complicated urinary tract infections Cases of complicated urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalisation have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including JARDIANCE (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Patients should be alerted to the symptoms of urinary tract infection, and advised to seek treatment promptly. JARDIANCE PI0145-21 4 Discontinuation of empagliflozin may be considered in cases of recurrent urinary tract infections. Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene) Cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier’s gangrene), a rare, but serious and life-threatening necrotising infection, have been reported in female and male patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Serious outcomes have included hospitalisation, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with JARDIANCE who present with pain or tenderness, erythema, swelling in the genital or perineal area, fever, malaise should be evaluated for necrotising fasciitis. If suspected, JARDIANCE should be discontinued and prompt treatment should be instituted (including broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement if necessary). Use in patients at risk for volume depletion Based on the mode of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, osmotic diuresis accompanying glucosuria may lead to a modest decrease in BP. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients for whom an empagliflozin-induced drop in BP could pose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on diuretics, patients with a history of hypotension or patients aged 75 years and older. In case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, BP measurements, laboratory tests including haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving empagliflozin. Temporary interruption of treatment with JARDIANCE should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected. Lower limb amputations An increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in a long-term clinical study with another SGLT2 inhibitor. The medicine in that study is not empagliflozin. However, it is unknown whether this constitutes a class effect. In a pooled safety analysis of 12,620 patients with T2DM the frequency of patients with lower limb amputations was similar between empagliflozin and placebo. In the largest placebo-controlled trial in 7020"}

The medicine in that study is not empagliflozin. However, it is unknown whether this constitutes a class effect. In a pooled safety analysis of 12,620 patients with T2DM the frequency of patients with lower limb amputations was similar between empagliflozin and placebo. In the largest placebo-controlled trial in 7020 patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial), in which 88% of all the cases of amputations were reported, lower limb amputations occurred in 1.8% of patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg, in 2.0% of patients treated with empagliflozin 25 mg, and in 1.8% of patients in the placebo arm. It is important to regularly examine the feet and counsel all diabetic patients on routine preventative footcare. Use in renal impairment Empagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating empagliflozin. Patients with hypovolaemia may be more susceptible to these changes. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalisation and dialysis, in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age. Due to limited experience, it is not recommended to initiate treatment with empagliflozin in patients with an eGFR <20 mL/min/1.73 m2. Glycaemic efficacy of empagliflozin is dependent on renal function and likely absent in patients with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration - Patients with renal impairment). JARDIANCE PI0145-21 5 Monitoring of renal function Assessment of renal function is recommended: • prior to empagliflozin initiation and periodically during treatment, i.e. at least yearly; • prior to initiation of concomitant medicines that may reduce renal function and periodically thereafter. Patients treated with empagliflozin can experience an initial fall in eGFR. More intensive monitoring of renal function is recommended, particularly following treatment initiation, if empagliflozin is used in patients with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2, especially if the eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73m2. Cardiomyopathies and severe valvular heart disease Patients with cardiomyopathies associated with infiltration diseases (e.g. amyloidosis), accumulation diseases (e.g. haemochromatosis), muscular dystrophies, pericardial constriction, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or severe valvular disease with surgery expected were excluded from clinical trials of patients with symptomatic heart failure. Therefore, safety and efficacy in these patients has not been established. Patients with symptomatic heart failure of NYHA IV class Limited data on patients with NYHA IV symptoms (i.e. symptoms with minimal activity or at rest) are available. Use in the elderly Patients aged 75 years and older may be at increased risk of volume depletion, therefore, JARDIANCE should be prescribed with caution in these patients (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). In patients aged 85 years and older, initiation of JARDIANCE for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is not recommended due to limited therapeutic experience. Paediatric use Type 2 diabetes mellitus No data are available for children with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m² and children below 10 years of age. Heart failure Safety and effectiveness of JARDIANCE for the treatment of heart failure in children under 18 years of age have not been established. Chronic kidney disease Safety and effectiveness of JARDIANCE for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in children under 18 years of age have not been established. Effect on laboratory tests Urine will test positive for glucose while patients are taking JARDIANCE due to the nature of the mechanism of action of the SGLT2 inhibitors (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties). Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5- AG are unreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycaemic control. JARDIANCE PI0145-21 6 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS Pharmacodynamic Interactions Diuretics Empagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension. Insulin and insulin secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with empagliflozin (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration and 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)). Pharmacokinetic Interactions Lithium Empagliflozin may increase renal lithium excretion and the blood lithium levels may be decreased. Serum concentration of lithium should be monitored more frequently after empagliflozin initiation and dose changes. Please refer the patient to the lithium prescribing doctor in order to monitor serum concentration of lithium. In vitro assessment of drug interactions Empagliflozin does not inhibit, inactivate, or induce CYP450 isoforms. In vitro data suggest that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9. Empagliflozin does not notably inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9 or UGT2B7. At therapeutic doses, the potential for empagliflozin to reversibly inhibit or inactivate the major CYP450 and UGT isoforms is remote. Drug-drug interactions involving the major CYP450 and UGT isoforms with empagliflozin and concomitantly administered substrates of these enzymes are therefore considered unlikely. Empagliflozin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein, but it does not inhibit these efflux transporters at therapeutic doses. Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with drugs that are P-gp substrates. Empagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not OAT1 and OCT2. Empagliflozin does not inhibit any of these human uptake transporters at clinically relevant plasma concentrations and, as such, drug-drug interactions with substrates of these uptake transporters are considered unlikely. In vivo assessment of drug interactions No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic interactions were observed when empagliflozin was co-administered with other commonly used medicinal products. Based on results of pharmacokinetic studies no dose adjustment of JARDIANCE is recommended when co- administered with commonly prescribed medicinal products. Empagliflozin pharmacokinetics were similar with and without co-administration of metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, verapamil, ramipril, simvastatin, in torasemide and healthy volunteers and with or without co-administration of hydrochlorothiazide in patients with T2DM. Increases in overall exposure (AUC) of empagliflozin were seen following co-administration with gemfibrozil (59%), rifampicin (35%), or probenecid (53%). These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful. Empagliflozin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, digoxin, ramipril, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and oral contraceptives when co-administered in healthy volunteers. JARDIANCE PI0145-21 7 Paediatric population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on fertility No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for JARDIANCE. Studies in rats at doses up to 700 mg/kg/day, do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. In female rats this dose was 90- and 155-fold the systemic AUC exposure anticipated with a human dose of 10 and 25 mg. Use in pregnancy (Category D) There are limited data from the use of JARDIANCE in pregnant women. It is recommended to avoid the use of JARDIANCE during pregnancy unless clearly needed. Empagliflozin administered during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg in the rat or rabbit, which corresponds to approximately 48- and 122-times or 128- and 325-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin based on AUC exposure associated with the 25 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively. Doses of empagliflozin causing maternal toxicity in the rat also caused the malformation of bent limb bones at exposures approximately 155- and 393-times the clinical dose associated with the 25 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively. Maternally toxic doses in the rabbit also caused increased embryofetal loss at doses approximately 139- and 353-times the clinical dose associated with the 25 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively. Empagliflozin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20 resulted in reduced weight gain in offspring at >30 mg/kg/day (maternal exposures approximately 4- and 11-times those seen with a clinical dose of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively). No adverse effects on postnatal development were noted at 10 mg/kg/day (maternal exposures approximately equivalent to those seen with a clinical dose of 25 mg). Specialised studies in rats with other members of the pharmacological class have shown toxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to the second and third trimesters of human pregnancy. Similar effects have been seen for empagliflozin at approximately 11 times the clinical AUC exposure associated with the 25 mg dose. These findings were absent after a 13-week drug-free recovery period. JARDIANCE should be used in pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the patients justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Use in lactation No data in humans are available on excretion of empagliflozin into milk. Available nonclinical data in animals have shown excretion of empagliflozin in milk. Reduced body weight was observed in rats exposed to empagliflozin in utero and through the consumption of maternal milk (see Use in pregnancy (Category D)). Adverse effects on renal development have been observed in juvenile rats treated with other members of this pharmacological class. Similar effects were seen with empagliflozin but the findings were absent after a 13 week drug-free recovery. A risk to human newborns/infants cannot be excluded. It is recommended to discontinue breast feeding during treatment with JARDIANCE. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. JARDIANCE PI0145-21 8 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Reporting suspected adverse effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important.

It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals at http://www.tga.gov.au/reporting-problems. suspected reactions adverse asked report any are to Type 2 diabetes mellitus A total of 15,582 patients with T2DM were treated in clinical studies to evaluate the safety of empagliflozin, of which 10,004 patients were treated with empagliflozin, either alone or in combination with metformin, a sulfonylurea, a PPAR agonist, DPP4 inhibitors, or insulin. This pool includes the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study involving 7020 patients at high cardiovascular risk (mean age 63.1 years, 9.3% patients at least 75 years old, 28.5% women) treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg/day (n=2345), JARDIANCE 25 mg/day (n=2342), or placebo (n=2333) up to 4.5 years. The overall safety profile of empagliflozin in this study was comparable to the previously known safety profile. In the above described trials, the frequency of adverse effects leading to discontinuation was similar by treatment groups for placebo (5.6%), JARDIANCE 10 mg (5.0%) and JARDIANCE 25 mg (5.3%). Placebo controlled double-blinded trials of 18 to 24 weeks of exposure included 3534 patients, of which 1183 were treated with placebo, 1185 were treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg and 1166 were treated with JARDIANCE 25 mg (Table 1). The most frequent adverse drug reaction was hypoglycaemia, which depended on the type of background therapy used in the respective studies (Table 2).

The frequency of patients with hypoglycaemia was increased in patients treated with JARDIANCE compared to placebo when given as add-on to metformin plus sulfonylurea, and as add-on to insulin +/- metformin and +/- sulfonylurea (Table 2). Major hypoglycaemia (events requiring assistance) The frequency of patients with major hypoglycaemic events was low (<1%) and similar for JARDIANCE and placebo as monotherapy, as add-on to metformin +/- sulfonylurea, as add- on to pioglitazone +/- metformin, and as add-on with linagliptin + metformin. The frequency of patients with major hypoglycaemic events was increased in patients treated with JARDIANCE compared to placebo when given as add-on to insulin +/- metformin and +/- sulfonylurea.

Similar to placebo, urinary tract infection was reported more frequently for JARDIANCE in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections. The intensity of urinary tract infections was similar to placebo for mild, moderate, and severe intensity reports. Urinary tract infection events were reported more frequently for empagliflozin compared to placebo in female patients, but not in male patients. Vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infection Vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infections were reported more frequently for JARDIANCE 10 mg (4.0%) and JARDIANCE 25 mg (3.9%) compared to placebo (1.0%). These adverse events were reported more frequently for empagliflozin compared to placebo in female patients, and the difference in frequency was less pronounced in male patients. The genital tract infections were mild and moderate in intensity, none was severe in intensity. Cases of phimosis/ acquired phimosis have been reported concurrent with genital infections. Increased urination As expected via its mechanism of action, increased urination (as assessed by preferred term search including pollakiuria, polyuria, nocturia) was observed at higher frequencies in patients treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg (3.5%) and JARDIANCE 25 mg (3.3%) compared to placebo (1.4%). Increased urination was mostly mild or moderate in intensity. The frequency of reported nocturia was comparable between placebo and JARDIANCE (<1%). Volume depletion The overall frequency of volume depletion (including the predefined terms BP (ambulatory) decreased, SBP decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolaemia, orthostatic hypotension and syncope) was similar to placebo (0.6% for JARDIANCE 10 mg, 0.4% for JARDIANCE 25 mg and 0.3% for placebo). The effect of empagliflozin on urinary glucose excretion is associated with osmotic diuresis, which could affect hydration status of patients aged 75 years and older. In patients ≥75 years of age (pooling of all patients with diabetes, n=13,402) the frequency of volume depletion events was similar for JARDIANCE 10 mg (2.3%) compared to placebo (2.1%), but it increased with JARDIANCE 25 mg (4.3%). JARDIANCE PI0145-21 11 Blood creatinine increased and glomerular filtration rate decreased Use of empagliflozin was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR. These changes were observed to reverse after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute haemodynamic changes play a role in the renal function abnormalities observed with empagliflozin. Renal-related adverse reactions (e.g. acute kidney injury, renal impairment, acute prerenal failure) may occur in patients treated with empagliflozin. The overall frequency of patients with increased blood creatinine and decreased glomerular filtration rate was similar between empagliflozin and placebo (blood creatinine increased: JARDIANCE 10 mg 0.6%, JARDIANCE 25 mg 0.1%, placebo 0.5%; glomerular filtration rate decreased: empagliflozin 10 mg 0.1%, empagliflozin 25 mg 0%, placebo 0.3%). In placebo-controlled, double-blind studies up to 76 weeks, initial transient increases in creatinine (mean change from baseline after 12 weeks: JARDIANCE 10 mg 0.0011 mmol/L, JARDIANCE 25 mg 0.0006 mmol/L) and initial transient decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rates (mean change from baseline after 12 weeks: JARDIANCE 10 mg -1.34 mL/min/1.73m2, JARDIANCE 25 mg -1.37 mL/min/1.73m2) have been observed. These changes were generally reversible during continuous treatment or after drug discontinuation (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Clinical trials - Cardiovascular outcome - Figure 4 for the eGFR course in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study). Paediatric population In the DINAMO trial 157 children aged 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes were treated, in which 52 patients received empagliflozin, 52 linagliptin and 53 placebo (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Clinical trials; Table 3). 65 paediatric patients were exposed to empagliflozin for at least 26 weeks, and 44 paediatric patients for at least 46 weeks.

None of these events was severe or required assistance. Overall, the safety profile in children was similar to the safety profile in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adverse effects based on trials in heart failure The pooled EMPEROR studies included patients with heart failure and either reduced ejection fraction (N = 3726) or preserved ejection fraction (N = 5985) treated with 10 mg empagliflozin (N = 4859) or placebo (N = 4852). Approximately half of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The most frequent adverse drug reaction was volume depletion (empagliflozin 10 mg: 11.4%; placebo: 9.7%). The overall safety profile of JARDIANCE in heart failure patients was generally consistent with that observed in the type 2 diabetes mellitus population. Chronic kidney disease The EMPA-KIDNEY study included patients with chronic kidney disease (N = 6609) treated with 10 mg empagliflozin or placebo. About 44% of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The most frequent adverse events in the EMPA-KIDNEY study were gout (empagliflozin 7.0% vs placebo 8.0%), and acute kidney injury (empagliflozin 2.8% vs placebo 3.5%) which were more frequently reported in patients on placebo. No new adverse reactions were identified in the EMPA-KIDNEY study. The overall safety profile of JARDIANCE was generally consistent across the studied indications. Laboratory parameters Haematocrit increased In a pooled safety analysis (pooling of all patients with diabetes, n=13,402), mean changes from baseline in haematocrit were 3.4% and 3.6% for empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg, respectively, compared to -0.1% for placebo. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, JARDIANCE PI0145-21 13 haematocrit values returned towards baseline values after a follow-up period of 30 days after treatment stop. Serum lipids increased In a pooled safety analysis (pooling of all patients with diabetes, n=13,402), mean percent increases from baseline for empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg versus placebo, respectively, were total cholesterol 4.9% and 5.7% versus 3.5%; HDL-cholesterol 3.3% and 3.6% versus 0.4%; LDL-cholesterol 9.5% and 10.0% versus 7.5%; triglycerides 9.2% and 9.9% versus 10.5%. Postmarketing experience The following postmarketing case reports have been reported during post-approval use of JARDIANCE. Because these cases are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Metabolism and nutrition disorders - Ketoacidosis Infections and infestations - Pyelonephritis, urosepsis, necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene) Immune system disorders - Allergic skin reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria), angioedema Reproductive system and breast disorders – Phimosis. 4.9 OVERDOSE For information on the management of overdose, contact the Poisons Information Centre on 131126 (Australia). During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg empagliflozin, were well tolerated. Treatment In the event of an overdose, supportive treatment should be initiated as appropriate to the patient’s clinical status. The removal of empagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied. 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Pharmacotherapeutic group: SGLT2 Inhibitor, ATC code: A10BK03. 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Mechanism of action Empagliflozin is a reversible competitive inhibitor of SGLT2 with an IC50 of 1.3 nM. It has a 5000-fold selectivity over human SGLT1 (IC50 of 6278 nM), responsible for glucose absorption in the gut. SGLT2 is highly expressed in the kidney, whereas expression in other tissues is absent or very low. It is responsible as the predominant transporter for re-absorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hyperglycaemia a higher amount of glucose is filtered and reabsorbed. Empagliflozin improves glycaemic control in patients with T2DM by reducing renal glucose re- absorption. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Through inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with T2DM and hyperglycaemia, excess glucose is excreted in the urine. In patients with T2DM, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following the first dose of empagliflozin and is continuous over the 24 hour dosing interval. Increased urinary glucose JARDIANCE PI0145-21 14 excretion was maintained at the end of 4-week treatment period, averaging approximately 78 g/day with empagliflozin 25 mg once daily. Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in plasma glucose levels in patients with T2DM. Empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels. There is no direct effect on changes in β cell function and insulin secretion / action, and this contributes to a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell function including Homeostasis Model Assessment-β (HOMA-β) and proinsulin to insulin ratio were noted. In addition urinary glucose excretion triggers calorie loss, associated with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The glucosuria observed with empagliflozin is accompanied by mild diuresis which may contribute to sustained and moderate reduction of blood pressure (BP). Empagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to: increasing tubuloglomerular feedback, reducing intraglomerular pressure, downregulating sympathetic activity, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and reducing left ventricular wall stress as evidenced by beneficial effects on filling pressures and diastolic function as well as preserving kidney structure and function. Other effects such as an increase in haematocrit, a reduction in body weight and blood pressure may underlie some of the cardiac and renal beneficial effects. Clinical Trials Type 2 diabetes mellitus A total of 17,331 patients with T2DM were evaluated in 15 double-blind, placebo- and active- controlled clinical studies, of which 4603 patients received empagliflozin 10 mg and 5567 received empagliflozin 25 mg. Six studies had a treatment duration of 24 weeks; in extensions of applicable studies, and other trials, patients were exposed to JARDIANCE for up to 102 weeks. Treatment with empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylurea, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and insulin lead to clinically relevant improvements in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP, respectively). Administration of empagliflozin 25 mg resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c goal of ≤7% and fewer patients needing glycaemic rescue compared to empagliflozin 10 mg and placebo. There was a clinically meaningful improvement in HbA1c in all subgroups of gender, race, geographic region, time since diagnosis of T2DM, BMI, insulin resistance based on HOMA-IR, and beta cell function based on HOMA-β. Higher baseline HbA1c was associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c. Clinically meaningful HbA1c reduction was seen in patients with eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73m² (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration - Patients with renal impairment). In patients aged 75 years and older, reduced efficacy of JARDIANCE was observed. Empagliflozin as monotherapy The efficacy and safety of empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) as monotherapy was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study of 24 weeks duration in treatment-naïve patients. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment. The key secondary endpoints were the change from baseline in body weight and blood pressure (systolic, SBP and diastolic, DBP) after 24 weeks of treatment. Treatment with JARDIANCE resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c, body weight and SBP compared to placebo (Table 4) and a clinically meaningful decrease in FPG. A numerical decrease in DBP was seen but did not reach statistical significance versus JARDIANCE PI0145-21 15 placebo (-1.0 mmHg for empagliflozin 10 mg, -1.9 mmHg for empagliflozin 25 mg, -0.5 mmHg for placebo, and +0.7 mmHg for sitagliptin). In a prespecified analysis of patients (n=201) with a baseline HbA1c ≥8.5% to ≤10% empagliflozin resulted in a reduction in HbA1c from baseline of -1.44% for empagliflozin 10 mg, -1.43% for empagliflozin 25 mg, +0.01% for placebo, and -1.04% for sitagliptin. In the double-blind placebo-controlled extension of this study, reductions of HbA1c (change from baseline of -0.65% for empagliflozin 10 mg, -0.76% for empagliflozin 25 mg, +0.13% for placebo, and -0.53% for sitagliptin), body weight (change from baseline of -2.24 kg for empagliflozin 10 mg, -2.45 kg for empagliflozin 25 mg, -0.43 kg for placebo, and +0.10 kg for sitagliptin) and BP (SBP: change from baseline of -4.1 mmHg for empagliflozin 10 mg, -4.2 mmHg for empagliflozin 25 mg, -0.7 mmHg for placebo, and -0.3 mmHg for sitagliptin, DBP: change from baseline of -1.6 mmHg for empagliflozin 10 mg, -1.6 mmHg for empagliflozin 25 mg, -0.6 mmHg for placebo, and -0.1 mmHg for sitagliptin) were sustained up to 76 weeks of treatment. Treatment with JARDIANCE daily significantly improved marker of beta cell function, including HOMA-β.

The majority of patients had been diagnosed with diabetes for up to a year (55.8%) or for between one and five years (28.6%). Their mean age was 52.6 years and mean BMI was 30.37 kg/m². Treatment with empagliflozin in combination with metformin (5 mg and 500 mg; 5 mg and 1000 mg; 12.5 mg and 500 mg, and 12.5 mg and 1000 mg given twice daily) provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and led to significantly greater reductions in FPG and body weight compared to the individual components. A greater proportion of patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥7.0% and treated with empagliflozin in combination with metformin achieved a target HbA1c <7% compared to the individual components (Tables 6 and 7).

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 18 weeks of treatment. The key secondary endpoints were the change from baseline in dose of basal insulin dose after 78 weeks of treatment and change from baseline in HbA1c after 78 weeks of treatment. During the initial 18 weeks the insulin dose was to be kept stable, but was adjusted to achieve a FPG <6.10 mmol/L in the following 60 weeks. At week 18, empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg) provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c compared to placebo. A greater proportion of patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥7.0% achieved a target HbA1c of <7% compared to placebo. At 78 weeks, empagliflozin resulted in a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c and insulin sparing compared to placebo (Table 11).

Cardiovascular outcome The EMPA-REG OUTCOME study is a multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of JARDIANCE as adjunct to standard care JARDIANCE PI0145-21 27 therapy in reducing cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with type 2 diabetes and one or more CV risk factors, including coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, history of myocardial infarction (MI), or history of stroke. The primary endpoint was the time to first event in the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, or non-fatal stroke (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE-3)). Additional pre-specified endpoints addressing clinically relevant outcomes tested in an exploratory manner included CV death, the composite of heart failure requiring hospitalisation or CV death, all-cause mortality and the composite of new or worsening nephropathy. A total of 7020 patients were treated with JARDIANCE (empagliflozin 10 mg: 2345, empagliflozin 25 mg: 2342, placebo: 2333) and followed for a median of 3.1 years. The population was 72.4% Caucasian, 21.6% Asian, and 5.1% Black. The mean age was 63 years and 71.5% were male. At baseline, approximately 81% of patients were being treated with renin angiotensin system inhibitors, 65% with beta-blockers, 43% with diuretics, 89% with anticoagulants, and 81% with lipid lowering medication. Approximately 74% of patients were being treated with metformin at baseline, 48% with insulin and 43% with sulfonylurea. The baseline HbA1c was <7% in 6.0% of the patients, 7 to <8% in 43.7% of the patients, 8 to <9% in 33.2% of the patients, and ≥9% in 17.0% of the patients. The time since diagnosis of diabetes was ≤5 years for 18.0% of the patients, >5 to 10 years for 24.9% of the patients, and >10 years for 57.1% of the patients. About half of the patients (52.2%) had an eGFR of 60-90 mL/min/1.73m2, 17.8% of 45-60 mL/min/1.73m2 and 7.7% of 30-45 mL/min/1.73m2. Mean systolic BP was 136 mmHg, diastolic BP 76 mmHg, low density lipoprotein (LDL) 2.2 mmol/L, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) 1.1 mmol/L. The urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) was normal in 59.4% of the patients, 28.7% had microalbuminuria, and 11% had macroalbuminuria. Reductions in risk of CV death and all-cause mortality JARDIANCE was superior in reducing the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke compared to placebo. The incidence rate was 37.1 for JARDIANCE (10 and 25 mg, pooled) compared to 43.9 with placebo. The treatment effect reflected a significant reduction in cardiovascular death with no significant change in non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke (Table 16 and Figure 1). JARDIANCE also improved all-cause mortality (Table 16), which was driven by a reduction in cardiovascular death with JARDIANCE. There was no statistically significant difference between empagliflozin and placebo in non-cardiovascular mortality.

A total of 1863 patients were randomised to empagliflozin 10 mg (placebo: 1867) and followed for a median of 15.7 months. The study population consisted of 76.1% men and 23.9% women with a mean age of 66.8 years (range: 25-94 years), 26.8% were 75 years of age or older. 70.5% of the study population were White, 18.0% Asian and 6.9% Black/African American. At randomisation, 75.1% of patients were NYHA class II, 24.4% were class III and 0.5% were class IV. The mean LVEF was 27.5%. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 62.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 and the median urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) was 22 mg/g. About half of the patients (51.7%) had an eGFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 24.1% of 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 18.6% of 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 5.3% 20 to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Empagliflozin was superior in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure compared with placebo, primarily driven by hospitalisation for heart failure. Additionally, empagliflozin significantly reduced the JARDIANCE PI0145-21 32 risk of occurrence of HHF (first and recurrent), and significantly reduced the rate of eGFR decline (see Table 19).

Empagliflozin in patients with heart failure and an ejection fraction >40% A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (EMPEROR-Preserved) was conducted in 5988 patients with chronic heart failure of at least 3 months duration (NYHA II-IV) who are currently stable and have an ejection fraction >40% to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin 10 mg once daily as adjunct to standard of care therapy. The primary endpoint was the time to adjudicated first event of either cardiovascular (CV) death or hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF). The secondary endpoints occurrence of adjudicated HHF (first and recurrent), and eGFR(CKD-EPI)cr slope of change from baseline were included in the confirmatory testing. Overall, baseline therapy included ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor (86.3%), blockers/angiotensin mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (37.5%) and diuretics (86.2%). (80.7%), beta blockers receptor-neprilysin inhibitor A total of 2997 patients were randomised to empagliflozin 10 mg (placebo: 2991) and followed for a median of 26.2 months. The study population consisted of 55.3% men and 44.7% women with a mean age of 71.9 years (range: 22-100 years), 43.0% were 75 years of age or older. 75.9% of the study population were White, 13.8% Asian and 4.3% Black/African American. At randomisation, 81.5% of patients were NYHA class II, 18.1% were class III and 0.3% were class IV. The EMPEROR-Preserved study population included patients with a LVEF <50% (33.1%), with a LVEF 50 to <60% (34.4%) and a LVEF ≥60% (32.5%). At baseline, the mean eGFR was 60.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 and the median urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) was 21 mg/g. About half of the patients (50.1%) had an eGFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 26.1% of 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 18.6% of 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 4.9% 20 to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. About half of the patients (49.1%) had diabetes at baseline, of whom almost all had type 2 diabetes (10 patients had type 1 diabetes). 33.1% had pre-diabetes (HbA1c JARDIANCE PI0145-21 36 ≥5.7% and <6.5%). At baseline, 51.1% of the patients had a history of atrial fibrillation. The most common causes of HF were hypertension (36.5% of patients) and ischaemia (35.4%). Patients with (e.g. haemochromatosis), muscular dystrophies, pericardial constriction, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or severe valvular disease with surgery expected were excluded from the trial. (e.g. amyloidosis), accumulation diseases infiltration diseases Empagliflozin was superior in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure (primarily driven by hospitalisation for heart failure) compared with placebo. Additionally, empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of occurrence of HHF (first and recurrent), and significantly reduced the rate of eGFR decline (see Table 20).

Chronic kidney disease A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of empagliflozin 10 mg once daily (EMPA-KIDNEY) was conducted in 6609 patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR ≥20 - <45 mL/min/1.73 m2; or eGFR ≥45 - <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 with a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] ≥200 mg/g) to assess cardio-renal outcomes as adjunct to standard of care therapy. This trial excluded patients with polycystic kidney disease, or receiving maintenance dialysis, or patients who had received a kidney transplant. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of kidney disease progression (sustained ≥40% eGFR decline from randomisation, sustained eGFR <10 mL/min/1.73 m2, end-stage kidney disease, or renal death) or CV death. All-cause hospitalisation (first and recurrent), first occurrence of hospitalisation for heart failure or CV death, and all-cause mortality were included in the confirmatory testing. Baseline therapy included an appropriate use of a RAS- inhibitor (85.2% ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker). A total of 3304 patients were randomised to empagliflozin 10 mg (placebo: 3305) and followed for a median of 24.3 months. The study population consisted of 66.8% men and 33.2% women with a mean age of 63.3 years (range: 18-94 years), 23.0% were 75 years of age or older. 58.4% of the study population were White, 36.2% Asian and 4.0% Black/ African American. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 37.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, 21.2% patients had an eGFR of ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2, 44.3% of 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 34.5% <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 JARDIANCE PI0145-21 41 including 254 patients with an eGFR <20 mL/min/1.73 m2. The median UACR was 329 mg/g, 20.1% patients had an UACR <30 mg/g, 28.2% had an UACR 30 to ≤300 mg/g and 51.7% had an UACR >300 mg/g; 41.1% of patients had an UACR <200 mg/g. Primary causes of chronic kidney disease were diabetic nephropathy/diabetic kidney disease (31%), glomerular disease (25%), hypertensive/renovascular disease (22%) and other/unknown (22%). Empagliflozin was superior in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of kidney disease progression or CV death compared with placebo (see Table 21). Additionally, empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of all-cause hospitalisation (first and recurrent).

Treatment benefits were more clearly evident in patients with higher levels of albuminuria. the annual rate of eGFR decline compared Empagliflozin slowed to placebo by 1.37 mL/min/1.73 m2/year (95% CI 1.16, 1.59), based on a pre-specified analysis of all eGFR measurements taken from the 2-month visit to the final follow-up visit. Patients treated with empagliflozin experienced an initial drop in eGFR which returned towards baseline after treatment discontinuation as demonstrated in several of the empagliflozin studies, supporting that haemodynamic changes play a role in the acute effects of empagliflozin on eGFR. Paediatric population The clinical efficacy and safety of empagliflozin 10 mg with a possible dose-increase to 25 mg or linagliptin 5 mg once daily has been studied in children and adolescents from 10 to 17 years of age with T2DM in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group study (DINAMO) over 26 weeks, with a double-blind active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks. A total of 157 patients were treated with either empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg; N=52), linagliptin (N=52), or placebo (N=53). Background therapies as adjunct to diet and exercise included metformin (51%), a combination of metformin and insulin (40.1%), insulin (3.2%), or none JARDIANCE PI0145-21 44 (5.7%). The mean HbA1c was 8.03% at baseline. The study population consisted of 38.2% male and 61.8% female patients with a mean age of 14.5 years (range: 10 to 17 years); 51.6% were 15 years of age or older. 49.7% of the study population were White, 5.7% Asian and 31.2% Black/African American. The mean BMI was 36.04 kg/m2, the mean body weight was 99.92 kg. Only patients with an eGFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were included in the DINAMO study. Empagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the primary endpoint change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of 26 weeks regardless of rescue therapy or treatment discontinuation. In addition, treatment with JARDIANCE resulted in a decrease in FPG (Table 22).

After oral administration, empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) with a median time to reach Cmax (tmax) of 1.5 h post-dose. Thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow terminal phase. The steady state mean plasma area under the curve (AUC) was 4740 nmol·h/L and Cmax was 687 nmol/L with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily. Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner. The single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics parameters of empagliflozin were similar suggesting linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time. There were no clinically relevant differences in empagliflozin pharmacokinetics between healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM. Administration of 25 mg empagliflozin after intake of a high-fat and high calorie meal resulted in slightly lower exposure; AUC decreased by approximately 16% and Cmax decreased by approximately 37%, compared to fasted condition. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not considered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food. Distribution The apparent steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73.8 L, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin JARDIANCE PI0145-21 45 solution to healthy subjects, the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 36.8% and plasma protein binding was 86.2%. Metabolism No major metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in human plasma and the most abundant metabolites were three glucuronide conjugates (2-O-, 3-O-, and 6-O-glucuronide). Systemic exposure of each metabolite was less than 10% of total drug-related material. In vitro studies suggested that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9. Excretion The apparent terminal elimination half-life of empagliflozin was estimated to be 12.4 h and apparent oral clearance was 10.6 L/h based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. The inter-subject and residual variabilities for empagliflozin oral clearance were 39.1% and 35.8%, respectively. With once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were reached by the fifth dose. Consistent with half-life, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to plasma AUC, was observed at steady-state. Following administration of an oral [14C]- empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects, approximately 95.6% of the drug related radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (41.2%) or urine (54.4%). The majority of drug related radioactivity recovered in faeces was unchanged parent drug and approximately half of drug related radioactivity excreted in urine was unchanged parent drug. Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups Pharmacokinetics in children Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of empagliflozin 5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg were investigated in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with T2DM. The observed pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (urinary glucose excretion) relationship of adult and paediatric patients was comparable after accounting for significant covariates."}

Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups Pharmacokinetics in children Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of empagliflozin 5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg were investigated in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with T2DM. The observed pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (urinary glucose excretion) relationship of adult and paediatric patients was comparable after accounting for significant covariates. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (HbA1c change from baseline) of empagliflozin 10 mg with a possible dose-increase to 25 mg were investigated in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with T2DM. The observed exposure-response relationship was overall comparable in adults and children and adolescents. Oral administration of empagliflozin resulted in an exposure within the range observed in adult patients. Pharmacokinetics in the elderly Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment (eGFR: patients with mild 60 - <90 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate (eGFR: In 30 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2), severe (eGFR: <30 mL/min/1.73m2) renal impairment and patients with kidney failure/end stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients, AUC of empagliflozin increased by approximately 18%, 20%, 66%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were similar in subjects with moderate renal impairment and kidney failure/ESKD compared to patients with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were roughly 20% higher in subjects with mild and severe renal impairment as compared to subjects with normal renal function. In line with the Phase I study, the population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the apparent oral clearance of empagliflozin decreased with a decrease in eGFR leading to an increase in drug exposure. Based on pharmacokinetics, no dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency. JARDIANCE PI0145-21 46 Pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment In subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment according to the Child-Pugh classification, AUC of empagliflozin increased approximately by 23%, 47%, and 75% and Cmax by approximately 4%, 23%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Based on pharmacokinetics, no dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. Body Mass Index (BMI) No dosage adjustment is necessary based on BMI. Body mass index had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Gender No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Race No dosage adjustment is necessary based on race. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, AUC was estimated to be 13.5% higher in Asian patients with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 compared to non-Asian patients with a BMI of 25 kg/m2. 5.3 PRECLINICAL SAFETY DATA Genotoxicity Empagliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of genotoxicity studies, including the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay (bacterial reverse mutation), in vitro mouse lymphoma tk assays and in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. Carcinogenicity Two-year oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. There was an increase in renal adenomas and carcinomas in male mice given empagliflozin at 1000 mg/kg/day. No renal tumours were seen at 300 mg/kg/day (11- and 28-times the exposure at the clinical dose of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively). These tumours are likely associated with a metabolic pathway not present in humans, and are considered to be irrelevant to patients given 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin. No drug-related tumours were seen in female mice or female rates at doses up to 1000 and 700 mg/kg/day, respectively, resulting in exposures at least 60 times that expected at the clinical dose of 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin. In male rats, treatment-related benign vascular proliferative lesions (haemangiomas) of the mesenteric lymph node, were observed at 700 mg/kg/day, but not at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 26- and 65-times the exposure at the clinical does of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively). These tumours are common in rats and are unlikely to be relevant to humans. 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 LIST OF EXCIPIENTS Tablet core: lactose monohydrate microcrystalline cellulose hyprolose croscarmellose sodium colloidal anhydrous silica JARDIANCE PI0145-21 47 magnesium stearate.

Product details How do I use Brintellix? 1. Why am I using Brintellix? Brintellix contains the active ingredient vortioxetine. Brintellix is thought to work by its actions on multiple brain chemicals including serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine, histamine and acetylcholine which are thought to be involved in controlling mood and related mental processes. Brintellix is used to treat major depression in adults. Depression is longer lasting or more severe than the \"low moods\" everyone has from time to time due to the stress of everyday life. It is thought to be caused by a chemical imbalance in parts of the brain. This imbalance affects your whole body and can cause emotional, physical and cognitive symptoms such as feeling low in spirit, reduced ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, loss of interest in activities, being unable to enjoy life, poor appetite or overeating, disturbed sleep, often waking up early, loss of sex drive, lack of energy and feeling guilty over nothing. 2.

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Some medicines may interfere with Brintellix and affect how it works. These include: ⦁ Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including selegiline, rasagiline, linezolid and moclobemide. You must stop taking MAOIs at least two weeks before starting Brintellix. You must wait at least one day after finishing moclobemide before you start Brintellix. Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet. If you do not understand the instructions on the label, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help. How much to take ⦁ ⦁ Your doctor will tell you how much Brintellix to take each day. Take the amount your doctor tells you to. The usual dose for Brintellix in adults less than 65 years of age is 10 mg taken orally as one daily dose. The dose may be increased by your doctor to a Brintellix® 3 maximum of 20 mg per day or lowered to a minimum of 5 mg per day. For elderly people 65 years of age or older, the starting dose is 5 mg taken once daily. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure of the correct dose for you. They will tell you exactly how much to take. Follow the instructions they give you. If you take the wrong dose, Brintellix may not work as well and your condition may not improve. ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ When to take Brintellix ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ Take Brintellix as a single dose either in the morning or in the evening. Take your medicine at about the same time each day. It does not matter if you take Brintellix before or after food. How to take Brintellix Swallow the tablets whole with a full glass of water. ⦁ How long to take it Continue to take Brintellix even if it takes some time before you feel any improvement in your condition. It may take two weeks, sometimes longer, before you feel any improvement. Continue to take Brintellix for as long as your doctor recommends. If your depression resolves while taking BRINTELLIX treatment should be continued for at least 6 months after you feel well again. Your doctor will check your progress at regular intervals. Do not change the dose or stop taking this medicine without first checking with your doctor. If you forget to use Brintellix Take the next dose at the usual time. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist. If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints. If you use too much Brintellix If you think that you have used too much Brintellix, you may need urgent medical attention.

JARDIAMET PI0157-19 1 4 CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS JARDIAMET is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults and children aged 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both empagliflozin and metformin is appropriate (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration and 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Clinical trials). Empagliflozin is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Clinical trials). To prevent cardiovascular deaths, empagliflozin should be used in conjunction with other measures to reduce cardiovascular risk in line with the current standard of care. 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION Life-threatening lactic acidosis can occur due to accumulation of metformin. Risk factors include renal impairment, old age and the use of high doses of metformin above 2000 mg per day. The recommended dose is one JARDIAMET tablet twice daily. Adults with normal renal function (GFR ≥ 90mL/min) The dosage should be individualised on the basis of the patient’s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. The maximum recommended daily dose of JARDIAMET is 25 mg of empagliflozin and 2000 mg of metformin (see Table 1 for additional dosing information). JARDIAMET should be given with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal undesirable effects associated with metformin. Treatment naïve patients The recommended starting dose is 5 mg/500 mg twice daily. If additional glycaemic control is required, adjust dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 25 mg empagliflozin and 2000 mg metformin. Patients switching from separate tablets of empagliflozin and metformin Patients switching from separate tablets of empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg total daily dose) and metformin to JARDIAMET, should receive the same daily dose of empagliflozin and metformin already being taken or the nearest therapeutically appropriate dose of metformin. Patients not adequately controlled on the maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone or in combination with other products, including insulin. The recommended starting dose of JARDIAMET should provide empagliflozin 5 mg twice daily (10 mg total daily dose) and the dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. In patients tolerating a total daily dose of empagliflozin 10 mg, the dose can be increased to a total daily dose of empagliflozin 25 mg. Combination use When JARDIAMET is used in combination with a sulfonylurea and/or insulin, a lower dose of sulfonylurea and/or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see Sections 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions and 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). JARDIAMET PI0157-19 2 Renal impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild renal impairment. JARDIAMET is contraindicated for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) (see Section 4.3 Contraindications). Renal function (including eGFR) should be assessed before initiation of treatment with JARDIAMET and at least annually thereafter. In patients at an increased risk of further progression of renal impairment and in the elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently, e.g. every 3-6 months (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). For dosing recommendations in the paediatric population see subsection paediatric patients below. Table 1 Dosage for renally impaired adult patients* eGFR mL/min/1.73m2 60 - 89 45 - 59 30 - 44 <30 Metformin Empagliflozin Maximum daily dose is 3000 mg.* Dose reduction may be considered in relation to declining renal function. Maximum daily dose is 2000 mg. The starting dose is at most half of the maximum dose. Maximum daily dose is 1000 mg.* The starting dose is at most half of the maximum dose. Metformin is contraindicated. Maximum daily dose is 25 mg. No dose adjustment is required. No dose adjustment is required. ** No dose adjustment is required. ** Empagliflozin is contraindicated * If no adequate strength of JARDIAMET is available, individual monocomponents should be used instead of the fixed dose combination. ** More intensive monitoring of renal function is recommended. Hepatic impairment JARDIAMET is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment due to the metformin component (see Section 4.3 Contraindications). Elderly Patients Patients age 75 years and older may be at an increased risk of volume depletion, therefore, JARDIAMET should be prescribed with caution in these patients. Therapeutic experience in patients aged 85 years and older is limited. Initiation of treatment in this population is not recommended (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use – Use in the elderly). Paediatric population The dosage should be individualised on the basis of the patient’s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. The recommended dose is one tablet twice daily. The maximum recommended daily dose of JARDIAMET is 25 mg of empagliflozin and 2000 mg of metformin (See general information above in see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration). No data are available for children with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m² and children below 10 years of age. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 3 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Hypersensitivity to active ingredients empagliflozin and/or metformin hydrochloride or to any of the excipients • Any type of metabolic acidosis (such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis) • Diabetic pre-coma • Severe renal failure (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min or eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2), which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, and septicaemia (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use) • Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as: dehydration, severe infection, shock, intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use) • Acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia such as: cardiac or respiratory failure, recent myocardial infarction, shock, pulmonary embolism, acute significant blood loss, sepsis, gangrene, pancreatitis (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use) • During or immediately following surgery where insulin is essential, elective major surgery • Hepatic impairment, acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism (due to the metformin component) • Lactation. JARDIAMET must be temporarily discontinued in patients undergoing radiologic studies involving intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials because use of such products may result in acute alteration of renal function (see Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use - Administration of iodinated contrast agent). 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE General JARDIAMET should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes (see Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications). Diabetic ketoacidosis JARDIAMET should not be used for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalisation, have been reported in postmarketing surveillance in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking empagliflozin. Patients treated with JARDIAMET who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels as ketoacidosis associated with JARDIAMET may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 13.8 mmol/L. Signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis may include excessive thirst, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalised malaise, and shortness of breath. If ketoacidosis is suspected, JARDIAMET should be discontinued, the patient should be evaluated and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis generally requires insulin, fluid, potassium and carbohydrate replacement. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 4 Diabetic ketoacidosis and glucosuria may be prolonged after discontinuation of JARDIAMET in some patients, i.e. it may last longer than expected from 5 plasma half-lives of empagliflozin (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved. Before initiating JARDIAMET, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis. Factors that predispose patients to ketoacidosis include a low carbohydrate diet, dehydration, acute illness, surgery (see Section Surgery), a previous ketoacidosis, insulin deficiency from any cause (including insulin pump failure, history of pancreatitis, or pancreatic surgery), malnourishment/reduced caloric intake or increased insulin requirements due to infections, and alcohol abuse. JARDIAMET should be used with caution in these patients. When reducing the insulin dose in patients requiring insulin, caution should be taken (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing JARDIAMET in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. In these situations, consider monitoring of ketones, even if JARDIAMET treatment has been interrupted. Lactic acidosis Lactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening of renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis.

Consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing JARDIAMET in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. In these situations, consider monitoring of ketones, even if JARDIAMET treatment has been interrupted. Lactic acidosis Lactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening of renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute worsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis. In case of dehydration (severe diarrhoea or vomiting, fever or reduced fluid intake), metformin should be temporarily discontinued and contact with a health care professional is recommended. Medicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and NSAIDs) should be initiated with caution in metformin-treated patients. Other risk factors for lactic acidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, prolonged fasting and any conditions associated with hypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal products that may cause lactic acidosis (see Sections 4.3 Contraindications and 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). Patients and/or care-givers should be informed of the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is characterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia followed by coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking metformin and be hospitalised immediately. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (< 7.35), increased plasma lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio. Cardiac function Patients with heart failure are more at risk of hypoxia and renal insufficiency. In patients with stable chronic heart failure, JARDIAMET may be used with a regular monitoring of cardiac and renal function. For patients with acute and unstable heart failure, JARDIAMET is contraindicated due to the metformin component (see Section 4.3 Contraindications). JARDIAMET PI0157-19 5 Use in patients at risk for volume depletion Based on the mode of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, osmotic diuresis accompanying therapeutic glucosuria may lead to a modest decrease in blood pressure. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients for whom an empagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could pose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension or patients aged 75 years and older. In case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving empagliflozin. Temporary interruption of treatment with JARDIAMET should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected. Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalisation in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Discontinuation of JARDIAMET may be considered in cases of recurrent urinary tract infections. Genital infections including life threatening necrotising fasciitis Cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier’s gangrene), a rare, but serious and life-threatening necrotising infection, have been reported in female and male patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Serious outcomes have included hospitalisation, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with JARDIAMET who present with pain or tenderness, erythema, swelling in the genital or perineal area, fever, malaise should be evaluated for necrotising fasciitis. If suspected, JARDIAMET should be discontinued and prompt treatment should be instituted (including broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement if necessary). Lower limb amputations An increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in a long-term clinical study with another SGLT2 inhibitor. The medicine in that study is not empagliflozin. However, it is unknown whether this constitutes a class effect. In a pooled safety analysis of 12,620 patients with T2DM the frequency of patients with lower limb amputations was similar between empagliflozin and placebo. In the largest placebo-controlled trial in 7020 patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial), in which 88% of all the cases of amputations were reported, lower limb amputations occurred in 1.8% of patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg, in 2.0% of patients treated with empagliflozin 25 mg, and in 1.8% of patients in the placebo arm. It is important to regularly examine the feet and counsel all diabetic patients on routine preventative footcare. Administration of iodinated contrast agent Intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, resulting in metformin accumulation and an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin should be discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration, and 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). JARDIAMET PI0157-19 6 Surgery Treatment with JARDIAMET should be ceased at least 48 hours prior to major surgery (see Sections Diabetic ketoacidosis and Lactic acidosis). An increase in other glucose lowering agents may be required during this time. Patients scheduled for non-urgent surgery who have not ceased JARDIAMET should be assessed and consideration should be given to postponing the procedure. Treatment with JARDIAMET may be restarted not earlier than 48 hours following surgery once the patient's condition has stabilised, oral intake is normal and only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal. Vitamin B12 levels In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum Vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or Vitamin B12 supplementation. It is recommended that vitamin B12 serum levels are monitored annually. The risk of low vitamin B12 levels increases with increasing metformin dose, treatment duration, and/or in patients with risk factors known to cause vitamin B12 deficiency (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Use in patients with renal impairment Empagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating empagliflozin. Patients with hypovolaemia may be more susceptible to these changes. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalisation and dialysis, in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age. Due to the mechanism of action, decreased renal function will result in reduced efficacy of empagliflozin. eGFR should be assessed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter, see section 4.2 Dose and method of administration. Patients treated with empagliflozin can experience an initial fall in eGFR. More intensive monitoring of renal function is recommended, particularly following treatment initiation, if empagliflozin is used in patients with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, especially if the eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2. JARDIAMET is contraindicated in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2 and should be temporarily discontinued in the presence of conditions that alter renal function, see section 4.3 Contraindications. Hypoglycaemia JARDIAMET alone does not cause hypoglycaemia under usual circumstances of use, but hypoglycaemia could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose- lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Use in the elderly Patients aged 75 years and older may be at an increased risk of volume depletion, therefore, JARDIAMET should be prescribed with caution in these patients (see Section 4.8 Adverse JARDIAMET PI0157-19 7 effects (Undesirable effects)). Therapeutic experience in patients aged 85 years and older is limited. Initiation of treatment in this population is not recommended. As metformin is excreted by the kidney, JARDIAMET should be used with caution as age increases. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin- associated lactic acidosis, particularly in elderly patients. Paediatric Use In the DINAMO paediatric trial conducted in 157 patients in which 52 patients received empagliflozin, 52 linagliptin and 53 placebo (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Clinical trials), the overall safety profile in children and adolescents was similar with the known safety profile seen in adult patients. Therefore, the precautions listed for adult patients must be followed also for the paediatric population. In the DINAMO trial, weight was assessed, after 26 weeks of treatment, there were no relevant differences between placebo and empagliflozin. No effect of metformin on growth and puberty has been detected during controlled clinical studies of one-year duration but no long-term data on these specific points are available. Therefore, a careful follow-up of the effect of metformin on these parameters in metformin- treated children, especially prepubescent children, is recommended. Children aged between 10 and 12 DINAMO trial included 157 patients and 91% were on metformin as background therapy, 25 of these patients were between 10 and 12 years old. Although efficacy and safety of metformin in these older children and adolescents did not differ from efficacy and safety in adults, particular caution is recommended when prescribing to children aged between 10 and 12 years. Effects on laboratory tests Urine will test positive for glucose while patients are taking JARDIAMET due to the nature of the mechanism of action of the SGLT2 inhibitors (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties). Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycaemic control. 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS General Co-administration of multiple doses of empagliflozin (50 mg once daily) and metformin hydrochloride (1000 mg twice daily) did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either empagliflozin or metformin in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies with JARDIAMET have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with empagliflozin and metformin alone. Paediatric population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 8 Empagliflozin Pharmacodynamic Interactions Diuretics Empagliflozin may add to the"}

Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies with JARDIAMET have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with empagliflozin and metformin alone. Paediatric population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 8 Empagliflozin Pharmacodynamic Interactions Diuretics Empagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension. Insulin and insulin secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with empagliflozin (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration and 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)). Pharmacokinetic Interactions Lithium Empagliflozin may increase renal lithium excretion and the blood lithium levels may be decreased. Serum concentration of lithium should be monitored more frequently after empagliflozin initiation and dose changes. Please refer the patient to the lithium prescribing doctor in order to monitor serum concentration of lithium. In vitro assessment of drug interactions Empagliflozin does not inhibit, inactivate, or induce CYP450 isoforms. In vitro data suggest that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7. Empagliflozin does not notably inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. At therapeutic doses, the potential for empagliflozin to reversibly inhibit or inactivate the major CYP450 and UGT isoforms is remote. Drug-drug interactions involving the major CYP450 and UGT isoforms with empagliflozin and concomitantly administered substrates of these enzymes are therefore considered unlikely. Empagliflozin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), but it does not inhibit these efflux transporters at therapeutic doses. Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with drugs that are P-gp substrates. Empagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not OAT1 and OCT2. Empagliflozin does not inhibit any of these human uptake transporters at clinically relevant plasma concentrations and, as such, drug-drug interactions with substrates of these uptake transporters are considered unlikely. In vivo assessment of drug interactions No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic interactions were observed when empagliflozin was co-administered with other commonly used medicinal products. Based on results of pharmacokinetic studies no dose adjustment of empagliflozin is recommended when co- administered with commonly prescribed medicinal products. Empagliflozin pharmacokinetics were similar with and without co-administration of glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, verapamil, ramipril, simvastatin, in healthy volunteers and with or without co-administration of torasemide and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with T2DM. Increases in overall exposure (AUC) of empagliflozin were seen following co-administration with gemfibrozil (59%), rifampicin (35%), or probenecid (53%). These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful. Empagliflozin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride, pioglitazone, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, torasemide and oral contraceptives when co-administered in healthy volunteers. linagliptin, warfarin, sitagliptin, ramipril, digoxin, JARDIAMET PI0157-19 9 Metformin hydrochloride Contraindicated combinations Iodinated contrast materials JARDIAMET must be discontinued prior to, or at the time of the imaging procedure and not be restarted until at least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see Sections 4.3 Contraindications and 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use - Administration of iodinated contrast materials). Inadvisable combinations Alcohol There is increased risk of lactic acidosis in acute alcohol intoxication (particularly in the case of fasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment) due to the metformin component of JARDIAMET (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use – Lactic acidosis). Consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing alcohol should be avoided. Alcohol may make the signs of hypoglycaemia less clear, and delayed hypoglycaemia can occur. The CNS depressant effects of alcohol plus hypoglycaemia can make driving or the operation of dangerous machinery much more hazardous. Combinations requiring precautions for use Some medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics. When starting or using such products in combination with metformin, close monitoring of renal function is necessary. Medicinal products with intrinsic hyperglycaemic activity e.g. glucocorticoids and tetracosactides (systemic and local routes), beta-2-agonists, danazol, chlorpromazine at high dosages of 100 mg per day and diuretics More frequent blood glucose monitoring may be required, especially at the beginning of treatment. If necessary, adjust the metformin dosage during therapy with the respective medicinal product and upon discontinuation. Diuretics, especially loop diuretics May increase the risk of lactic acidosis due to their potential to decrease renal function. ACE-inhibitors ACE-inhibitors may decrease the blood glucose levels. Therefore, dose adjustment of JARDIAMET may be necessary when such medicinal products are added or discontinued. Calcium channel blockers Calcium channel blockers may affect glucose control in diabetic patients; regular monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended. Beta-blockers Co-administration of metformin and beta-blockers may result in a potentiation of the anti- hyperglycaemic action. In addition, some of the premonitory signs of hypoglycaemia, in particular tachycardia, may be masked. Monitoring of blood glucose should be undertaken during dosage adjustment of either agent. Cimetidine Reduced clearance of metformin has been reported during cimetidine therapy, so a dose reduction should be considered. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 10 Anticoagulants Metformin increases the elimination rate of vitamin K antagonists. Consequently, the prothrombin time should be closely monitored in patients in whom metformin and vitamin K antagonists are being co-administered. Cessation of metformin in patients receiving vitamin K antagonists can cause marked increases in the prothrombin time. Nifedipine A single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of metformin and nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in the urine. Tmax and half-life of metformin were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Metformin had minimal effects on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Organic cation transporters (OCT) Metformin is a substrate of both transporters OCT1 and OCT2. Co-administration of metformin with: • Substrates/inhibitors of OCT1 (such as verapamil) may reduce efficacy of metformin. • Inducers of OCT1 (such as rifampicin) may increase gastrointestinal absorption and efficacy. • Substrates/inhibitors of OCT2 (such as cimetidine, dolutegravir, crizotinib, olaparib, daclatasvir, vandetanib) may decrease the renal elimination of metformin and thus lead to an increase in metformin plasma concentration. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with metformin hydrochloride tablet may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients. NSAID May increase the risk of lactic acidosis and adversely affect renal function. Therefore, caution is advised when these drugs are co-administered with metformin and a dose adjustment may be considered, particularly in patients with renal impairment. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on Fertility No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted with JARDIAMET or its individual components. Nonclinical studies in animals with the individual components do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. Empagliflozin Studies in rats at doses up to 700 mg/kg/day, do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. In female rats this dose was 90- and 155-fold the systemic AUC exposure anticipated with a human dose of 10 and 25 mg. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 11 Metformin hydrochloride Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons. Use in Pregnancy (Category D) There are limited data from the use of JARDIAMET or its individual components in pregnant women. When the patient plans to become pregnant, and during pregnancy, it is recommended that diabetes is not treated with JARDIAMET, but insulin be used to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible, to reduce the risk of malformations of the foetus associated with abnormal blood glucose levels. A study in pregnant rats did not reveal teratogenicity or other adverse effects on embryofetal development with co-administration of empagliflozin and metformin at oral doses up to 100/200 mg/kg/day, yielding exposures of approximately 35- and 14-times the clinical AUC exposure of empagliflozin associated with the 5 and 12.5 mg twice daily doses, respectively, and 4-times the clinical AUC exposure of metformin associated with the 1000 mg twice daily dose. At a dose of 300/600 mg/kg/day, associated with 49-times the exposure to empagliflozin and 8-times the exposure to metformin in humans at the maximum recommended dose, teratogenicity attributable to the metformin component was observed. Empagliflozin Empagliflozin administered during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg in the rat or rabbit, which corresponds to approximately 48- and 122-times or 128- and 325-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin based on AUC exposure associated with the 12.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily doses, respectively. Doses of empagliflozin causing maternal toxicity in the rat also caused the malformation of bent limb bones at exposures approximately 155- and 393-times the clinical dose associated with the 12.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily doses, respectively. Maternally toxic doses in the rabbit also caused increased embryofetal loss at doses approximately 139- and 353-times the clinical dose associated with the 12.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily doses, respectively. Empagliflozin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20 resulted in reduced weight gain in offspring at ≥30 mg/kg/day yielding maternal exposures approximately 4- and 11-times those in humans associated with 12.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily doses, respectively. Specialised studies in rats with other members of the pharmacological class have shown toxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to the second and third"}

Empagliflozin Empagliflozin administered during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg in the rat or rabbit, which corresponds to approximately 48- and 122-times or 128- and 325-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin based on AUC exposure associated with the 12.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily doses, respectively.

Empagliflozin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20 resulted in reduced weight gain in offspring at ≥30 mg/kg/day yielding maternal exposures approximately 4- and 11-times those in humans associated with 12.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily doses, respectively. Specialised studies in rats with other members of the pharmacological class have shown toxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to the second and third trimesters of human pregnancy. Similar effects have been seen for empagliflozin at approximately 11-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin based on AUC exposure associated with the 12.5 mg twice daily dose. These findings were absent after a 13 week drug-free recovery period. Metformin hydrochloride Metformin was not teratogenic in rats at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day associated with a systemic exposure 4 times that in patients at the maximum recommended human dose (2000 mg metformin per day). At higher doses (500 and 1000 mg/kg/day, associated with 11 and 23 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD), teratogenicity of metformin was observed in the rat which was mostly evident as an increase in the incidence of skeletal malformations. Use in Lactation Metformin is excreted into human breast milk. No adverse effects were observed in breastfed newborns/infants. It is unknown whether empagliflozin is excreted in human milk. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 12 Available nonclinical data in animals have shown excretion of empagliflozin in milk. Reduced body weight was observed in rats exposed to empagliflozin in utero and through the consumption of maternal milk (see Use in Pregnancy). Adverse effects on renal development have been observed in juvenile rats treated with other members of this pharmacological class. Similar effects were seen with empagliflozin but the findings were absent after a 13 week drug-free recovery. A risk to human newborns/infants cannot be excluded. It is recommended to discontinue breast feeding during treatment with JARDIAMET. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Low blood sugar may occur in patients who already take another medication to treat diabetes such as a sulfonylurea or insulin while taking JARDIAMET. The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance e.g. driving a car or operating machinery. People should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving or operating machinery. 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Reporting suspected adverse effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals at http://www.tga.gov.au/reporting-problems. suspected reactions adverse asked report any are to Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials A total of 12,245 patients with type 2 diabetes were treated in clinical studies to evaluate the safety of empagliflozin plus metformin, of which 8199 patients were treated with empagliflozin plus metformin, either alone, or in addition to a sulfonylurea, pioglitazone, DPP4 inhibitors, or insulin. In these trials 2910 patients received treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin and 3699 patients treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg plus metformin for at least 24 weeks and 2151 or 2807 patients for at least 76 weeks. The overall safety profile of empagliflozin plus metformin for patients enrolled in the EMPA- REG OUTCOME study was comparable to the previously known safety profile. Placebo controlled double-blind trials of 18 to 24 weeks of exposure included 3456 patients, of which 1271 were treated with empagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin and 1259 with empagliflozin 25 mg plus metformin. The most frequently reported adverse event in clinical trials was hypoglycaemia, which depended on the type of background therapy used in the respective studies (Table 2). No additional side effects were identified in clinical trials with empagliflozin plus metformin compared to the side effects of the single components. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The adverse reactions are listed by absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), or very rare (<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Consideration of such an aetiology is recommended if a patient presents with megaloblastic anaemia. Therefore, serum B12 levels should be appropriately monitored or periodic parenteral B12 supplementation should be considered (see Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use – Vitamin B12 levels). 5 Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite occur most frequently during initiation of therapy and resolve spontaneously in most cases. To prevent them, it is recommended that metformin be taken in 2 daily doses during or after meals. A slow increase in the metformin dose may also improve gastrointestinal tolerability. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 14 6 Isolated cases of liver function test abnormalities or hepatitis resolving upon metformin discontinuation have been reported. 7 not reported in paediatric trial (DINAMO) (48 patients exposed to empagliflozin and metformin) Postmarketing experience The following postmarketing case reports have been reported during post-approval use of empagliflozin. Because these cases are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Metabolism and nutrition disorders - Ketoacidosis Infections and infestations - Pyelonephritis, urosepsis, necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene) Immune system disorders - Allergic skin reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria), angioedema Reproductive system and breast disorders – Phimosis. Hypoglycaemia The frequency of hypoglycaemia depended on the background therapy in the respective studies and was similar to placebo for empagliflozin as add-on to metformin and as add-on to pioglitazone +/- metformin, and as add-on with linagliptin + metformin. The frequency of patients with hypoglycaemia was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo when given as add-on to metformin plus sulfonylurea, and as add-on to insulin +/- metformin and +/- sulfonylurea. (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration, Table 3 below). Major hypoglycaemia (events requiring assistance) The overall frequency of patients with major hypoglycaemic events was low (<1%) and similar for empagliflozin and placebo on a background of metformin. The frequency of major hypoglycaemia depended on the background therapy in the respective studies (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration; Table 3 below).

Empa 25 mg 2342 27.6% 1.3% Urinary tract infection The overall frequency of urinary tract infection adverse events was higher in patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin (8.8%) as compared to empagliflozin 25 mg plus metformin (6.6%) or placebo plus metformin (7.8%). Similar to placebo, urinary tract infection was reported more frequently for empagliflozin plus metformin in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections. The intensity of urinary tract infections was similar to placebo. Urinary tract infection events were reported more frequently for empagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin compared with placebo in female patients, but not for empagliflozin 25 mg plus metformin. The frequencies of urinary tract infections were low for male patients and were balanced across treatment groups. Vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infection Vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infections were reported more frequently for empagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin (4.0%) and empagliflozin 25 mg plus metformin (3.9%) compared to placebo plus metformin (1.3%), and were reported more frequently for empagliflozin plus metformin compared to placebo in female patients. The difference in frequency was less pronounced in male patients. Genital tract infections were mild and moderate in intensity, none was severe in intensity. Cases of phimosis/acquired phimosis have been reported concurrent with genital infections. Increased urination As expected via its mechanism of action, increased urination (as assessed by preferred term search including pollakiuria, polyuria, nocturia) was observed at higher frequencies in patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin (3.0%) and empagliflozin 25 mg plus metformin (2.9%) compared to placebo plus metformin (1.4%). Increased urination was mostly JARDIAMET PI0157-19 16 mild or moderate in intensity. The frequency of reported nocturia was comparable between placebo and empagliflozin, both on a background of metformin (<1%). Volume depletion The overall frequency of volume depletion (including the predefined terms blood pressure (ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolaemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope) was low and comparable to placebo (empagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin (0.6%), empagliflozin 25 mg plus metformin (0.3%) and placebo plus metformin (0.1%)). The effect of empagliflozin on urinary glucose excretion is associated with osmotic diuresis, which could affect the hydration status of patients age 75 years and older. In patients ≥75 years of age volume depletion events have been reported in a single patient treated with empagliflozin 25 mg plus metformin. Blood creatinine increased and glomerular filtration rate decreased Use of empagliflozin was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR. These changes were observed to reverse after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute haemodynamic changes play a role in the renal function abnormalities observed with empagliflozin. Renal-related adverse reactions (e.g. acute kidney injury, renal impairment, acute prerenal failure) may occur in patients treated with empagliflozin. The overall frequency of patients with increased blood creatinine and decreased glomerular filtration rate was similar between empagliflozin and placebo as add-on to metformin (blood creatinine increased: empagliflozin 10 mg 0.5%, empagliflozin 25 mg 0.1%, placebo 0.4%; glomerular filtration rate decreased: empagliflozin 10 mg 0.1%, empagliflozin 25 mg 0%, placebo 0.2%). In these placebo-controlled, double-blind studies up to 24 weeks, initial transient increases in creatinine (mean change from baseline after 12 weeks: empagliflozin 10 mg 0.001 mmol/L, empagliflozin 25 mg 0.001 mmol/L) and initial transient decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rates (mean change from baseline after 12 weeks: empagliflozin 10 mg -1.46 mL/min/1.73m2, empagliflozin 25 mg -2.05 mL/min/1.73m2) have been observed. In the long term studies, these changes were generally reversible during continuous treatment or after drug discontinuation (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Clinical Trials Figure 4 for the eGFR course in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study). Paediatric population In the DINAMO trial 157 children aged 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes were treated, in which 52 patients received empagliflozin, 52 linagliptin and 53 placebo (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Clinical Trials; Table 4). 65 paediatric patients were exposed to empagliflozin for at least 26 weeks, and 44 paediatric patients for at least 46 weeks.

None of these events was severe or required assistance. Overall, the safety profile in children was similar to the safety profile in adults with T2DM. Laboratory parameters Haematocrit increased In a pooled safety analysis of all trials with metformin background treatment, mean changes from baseline in haematocrit were 3.6% and 4.0% for empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg, respectively, compared to 0% for placebo. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, haematocrit values returned towards baseline values after a follow-up period of 30 days after treatment stop. Serum lipids increased In a pooled safety analysis of all trials with metformin background treatment, mean percent increases from baseline for empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg versus placebo, respectively, were total cholesterol 5.0% and 5.2% versus 3.7%; HDL-cholesterol 4.6% and 2.7% versus -0.5%; LDL-cholesterol 9.1% and 8.7% versus 7.8%; triglycerides 5.4% and 10.8% versus 12.1%. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 18 4.9 OVERDOSE For information on the management of overdose, contact the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 (Australia). Symptoms Empagliflozin During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg empagliflozin, equivalent to 32 times the maximum recommended daily dose, were well tolerated. Metformin hydrochloride Hypoglycaemia has not been seen with metformin hydrochloride doses of up to 85 g, although lactic acidosis has occurred in such circumstances. High overdose of metformin hydrochloride or concomitant risks may lead to lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in hospital. Therapy In the event of an overdose, supportive treatment should be initiated as appropriate to the patient’s clinical status. The most effective method to remove lactate and metformin hydrochloride is haemodialysis whereas removal of empagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied. 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Pharmacotherapeutic group: Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering drugs, ATC code: A10BD20. Mechanism of action Empagliflozin Empagliflozin is a reversible competitive inhibitor of SGLT2 with an IC50 of 1.3 nM. It has a 5000-fold selectivity over human SGLT1 (IC50 of 6278 nM), responsible for glucose absorption in the gut. SGLT2 is highly expressed in the kidney, whereas expression in other tissues is absent or very low. It is responsible as the predominant transporter for re-absorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hyperglycaemia a higher amount of glucose is filtered and reabsorbed. Empagliflozin improves glycaemic control in patients with T2DM by reducing renal glucose re- absorption. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Through inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with T2DM and hyperglycaemia, excess glucose is excreted in the urine. In patients with T2DM, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following the first dose of empagliflozin and is continuous over the 24 hour dosing interval. Increased urinary glucose excretion was maintained at the end of 4-week treatment period, averaging approximately 78 g/day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily. Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in plasma glucose levels in patients with T2DM. Empagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 19 The insulin independent mechanism of action of empagliflozin contributes to a low risk of hypoglycaemia. The effect of empagliflozin in lowering blood glucose is independent of beta cell function and insulin pathway. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell function including Homeostasis Model Assessment-β (HOMA-β) and proinsulin to insulin ratio were noted. In addition urinary glucose excretion triggers calorie loss, associated with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The glucosuria observed with empagliflozin is accompanied by mild diuresis which may contribute to sustained and moderate reduction of blood pressure (BP). Metformin hydrochloride Metformin hydrochloride is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia. Metformin hydrochloride may act via 3 mechanisms: 1) reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis 2) in muscle, by increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation 3) and delay of intestinal glucose absorption. Metformin hydrochloride stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase. Metformin hydrochloride increases the transport capacity of all types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUTs) known to date. In humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin hydrochloride has favourable effects on lipid metabolism. This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium or long-term clinical studies: metformin hydrochloride reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Clinical trials A total of 10,224 patients with type 2 diabetes were treated in 9 double-blind, placebo or active-controlled clinical studies, of at least 24 weeks"}

Administration of empagliflozin 25 mg resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving HbA1c goal of <7% and fewer patients needing glycaemic rescue compared to empagliflozin 10 mg and placebo. There was a clinically meaningful improvement in HbA1c in all subgroups of gender, race, geographic region, time since diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and body mass index (BMI). In patients aged 75 years and older, numerically lower reductions in HbA1c were observed with empagliflozin treatment. Higher baseline HbA1c was associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c. Empagliflozin in combination with metformin in drug-naïve patients led to clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c, FPG, body weight and BP. Empagliflozin as add on to metformin therapy A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 24 weeks duration was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in patients not sufficiently treated with metformin. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 20 Treatment with empagliflozin resulted in statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and body weight, and clinically meaningful reductions in FPG and BP compared to placebo (Table 5). In the double-blind placebo-controlled extension of this study, reductions of HbA1c (change from baseline of -0.62% for empagliflozin 10 mg, -0.74% for empagliflozin 25 mg and -0.01% for placebo), body weight (change from baseline of -2.39 kg for empagliflozin 10 mg, -2.65 kg for empagliflozin 25 mg and -0.46 kg for placebo) and BP (systolic BP: change from baseline of -5.2 mmHg for empagliflozin 10 mg, -4.5 mmHg for empagliflozin 25 mg and -0.8 mmHg for placebo, diastolic BP: change from baseline of -2.5 mmHg for empagliflozin 10 mg, -1.9 mmHg for empagliflozin 25 mg and -0.5 mmHg for placebo) were sustained up to Week 76.

The majority of patients had been diagnosed with diabetes for up to a year (55.8%) or for between one and five years (28.6%). Their mean age was 52.6 years and mean BMI was 30.37 kg/m². Treatment with empagliflozin in combination with metformin (5 mg and 500 mg; 5 mg and 1000 mg; 12.5 mg and 500 mg, and 12.5 mg and 1000 mg given twice daily) provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and led to significantly greater reductions in FPG and body weight compared to the JARDIAMET PI0157-19 21 individual components.

However, the effectiveness of JARDIAMET on reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease has not been established. The effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular risk in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease is presented below. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 31 The EMPA-REG OUTCOME study is a multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of empagliflozin as adjunct to standard care therapy in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and one or more cardiovascular risk factors, including coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, history of myocardial infarction (MI), or history of stroke. The primary endpoint was the time to first event in the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, or non-fatal stroke (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE-3). Additional pre-specified endpoints addressing clinically relevant outcomes tested in an exploratory manner included CV death, the composite of heart failure requiring hospitalisation or CV death, all-cause mortality and the composite of new or worsening nephropathy. A total of 7020 patients were treated with empagliflozin (empagliflozin 10 mg: 2345, empagliflozin 25 mg: 2342, placebo: 2333) and followed for a median of 3.1 years. Approximately 74% of patients were being treated with metformin at baseline, 48% with insulin and 43% with sulfonylurea. The population was 72.4% Caucasian, 21.6% Asian, and 5.1% Black. The mean age was 63 years and 71.5% were male. At baseline, approximately 81% of patients were being treated with renin angiotensin system inhibitors, 65% with beta-blockers, 43% with diuretics, 89% with anticoagulants, and 81% with lipid lowering medication. About half of the patients (52.2%) had an eGFR of 60-90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 17.8% of 45- 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 7.7% of 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Mean systolic BP was 136 mmHg, diastolic BP 76 mmHg, low density lipoprotein (LDL) 2.2 mmol/L, high density lipoprotein (HDL) 1.1 mmol/L, and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) 19.8 mg/mmol at baseline. Reductions in risk of CV death and overall mortality Empagliflozin is superior in reducing the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke compared to placebo. The treatment effect reflected a reduction in cardiovascular death with no significant change in non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke (Table 16 and Figure 1). Empagliflozin also improved overall survival (Table 16), which was driven by a reduction in cardiovascular death with empagliflozin. There was no statistically significant difference between empagliflozin and placebo in non-cardiovascular mortality.

A total of 157 patients were treated with either empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg; N=52), linagliptin (N=52), or placebo (N=53). Background therapies as adjunct to diet and exercise included metformin (51%), a combination of metformin and insulin (40.1%), insulin (3.2%), or none (5.7%). The mean HbA1c was 8.03% at baseline. The study population consisted of 38.2% male and 61.8% female patients with a mean age of 14.5 years (range: 10 to 17 years); 51.6% were 15 years of age or older. 49.7% of the study population were White, 5.7% Asian and 31.2% Black/African American. The mean BMI was 36.04 kg/m2, the mean body weight was 99.92 kg. Only patients with an eGFR of ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were included in the DINAMO study. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 36 Empagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the primary endpoint change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of 26 weeks regardless of rescue therapy or treatment discontinuation. In addition, treatment with empagliflozin resulted in decrease in FPG (see Table 19). Table 19 paediatric patients with type 2 diabetes (modified Intention To Treat Set) Results at 26-weeks in placebo-controlled study of empagliflozin in Placebo Empagliflozin (10 and 25 mg, pooled) N HbA1c (%)a Baseline (mean) Change from baselineb Difference from placebob (95% CI) p-value for superiority N FPG (mmol/L)c Baseline (mean) Change from baselineb Difference from placebob (SE) 53 8.05 0.68 52 8.80 0.87 52 8.00 -0.17 -0.84 (-1.50, -0.19) 0.0116 48 8.57 -1.08 -1.95 (0.66) a Multiple imputation with 500 iterations for missing data b mean adjusted for baseline value and stratification c Last observation carried forward (LOCF), including baseline values In a double blind, placebo-controlled study in 82 paediatric patients aged 10 to 16 years with type 2 diabetes (mean FPG 10.1 mmol/L), treatment with metformin (up to 2000 mg/day) for up to 16 weeks (mean duration of treatment 11 weeks) resulted in a significant mean net reduction in FPG of 3.6 mmol/L, compared with placebo. 5.2 PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES The results of bioequivalence studies in healthy subjects demonstrated that JARDIAMET (empagliflozin/metformin hydrochloride) 5 mg/500 mg, 5 mg/850 mg, 5 mg/1000 mg, 12.5 mg/500 mg, 12.5 mg/850 mg, and 12.5 mg/1000 mg combination tablets are bioequivalent to co-administration of corresponding doses of empagliflozin and metformin as individual tablets. Administration of 12.5 mg empagliflozin/1000 mg metformin under fed conditions resulted in a 9% decrease in AUC and a 28% decrease in Cmax for empagliflozin, when compared to fasted conditions. For metformin, AUC decreased by 12% and Cmax decreased by 26% compared to fasting conditions. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin and metformin is not considered to be clinically relevant. However, as metformin is recommended to be given with meals, JARDIAMET is also proposed to be given with food. The following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of JARDIAMET. Empagliflozin Absorption The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin have been extensively characterised in healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM. After oral administration, empagliflozin was rapidly JARDIAMET PI0157-19 37 absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring at a median tmax 1.5 h post-dose. Thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow terminal phase. The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 1870 nmol·h/L and 259 nmol/L with empagliflozin 10 mg and 4740 nmol·h/L and 687 nmol/L with empagliflozin 25 mg once daily, respectively. Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner. The single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics parameters of empagliflozin were linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time. There were no clinically relevant differences in empagliflozin pharmacokinetics between healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM. suggesting similar The pharmacokinetics of 5 mg empagliflozin twice daily and 10 mg empagliflozin once daily were compared in healthy subjects. Overall exposure (AUCss) of empagliflozin over a 24-hour period with 5 mg administered twice daily was similar to 10 mg administered once daily. As expected, empagliflozin 5 mg administered twice daily compared with 10 mg empagliflozin once daily resulted in lower Cmax and higher trough plasma empagliflozin concentrations (Cmin). Administration of 25 mg empagliflozin after intake of a high-fat and high calorie meal resulted in slightly lower exposure; AUC decreased by approximately 16% and Cmax decreased by approximately 37%, compared to fasted condition. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not considered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food. Distribution The apparent steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73.8 L, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects, the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 36.8% and plasma protein binding was 86.2%. Metabolism No major metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in human plasma and the most abundant metabolites were three glucuronide conjugates (2-O-, 3-O-, and 6-O-glucuronide). Systemic exposure of each metabolite was less than 10% of total drug-related material. In vitro studies suggested that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7. Excretion The apparent terminal elimination half-life of empagliflozin was estimated to be 12.4 h and apparent oral clearance was 10.6 L/h based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. The inter-subject and residual variabilities for empagliflozin oral clearance were 39.1% and 35.8%, respectively. With once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were reached by the fifth dose. Consistent with the half-life, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to plasma AUC, was observed at steady-state. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects, approximately 95.6% of the drug related radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (41.2%) or urine (54.4%). The majority of drug related radioactivity recovered in faeces was unchanged parent drug and approximately half of drug related radioactivity excreted in urine was unchanged parent drug. Metformin hydrochloride Absorption After an oral dose of metformin, tmax is reached in 2.5 hours. Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg or 850 mg metformin hydrochloride tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects. After an oral dose, the non-absorbed fraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 38 After oral administration, metformin hydrochloride absorption is saturable and incomplete. It is assumed that the pharmacokinetics of metformin hydrochloride absorption are non-linear. At the recommended metformin hydrochloride doses and dosing schedules, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally less than 1 microgram/mL. In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin hydrochloride plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed 5 microgram/mL, even at maximum doses. Food decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin hydrochloride. Following administration of a dose of 850 mg, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% decrease in AUC (area under the curve) and a 35 minute prolongation of the time to peak plasma concentration were observed. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. Distribution Plasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin hydrochloride partitions into erythrocytes. The blood peak is lower than the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time. The red blood cells most likely represent a secondary compartment of distribution. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) ranged between 63-276 L. Metabolism Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism. Excretion Renal clearance of metformin hydrochloride is >400 mL/min, indicating that metformin hydrochloride is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is approximately 6.5 hours. When renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to that of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of metformin hydrochloride in plasma. Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups Paediatric Empagliflozin Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of empagliflozin 5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg were investigated in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with T2DM. The observed pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (urinary glucose excretion) relationship of adult and paediatric patients was comparable after accounting for significant covariates.

The observed pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (urinary glucose excretion) relationship of adult and paediatric patients was comparable after accounting for significant covariates. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (HbA1c change from baseline) of empagliflozin 10 mg with a possible dose-increase to 25 mg were investigated in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with T2DM. The observed exposure-response relationship was overall comparable in adults and children and adolescents. Oral administration of empagliflozin resulted in an exposure within the range observed in adult patients. Metformin hydrochloride Single dose study: After single doses of metformin 500 mg, paediatric patients have shown a similar pharmacokinetic profile to that observed in healthy adults. Multiple dose study: Data are restricted to one study. After repeated doses of 500 mg twice daily for 7 days in paediatric patients the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and systemic exposure (AUC0-t) were reduced by approximately 33% and 40%, respectively compared to diabetic adults who received repeated doses of 500 mg twice daily for 14 days. As the dose is individually titrated based on glycaemic control, this is of limited clinical relevance. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 39 Elderly Empagliflozin Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin hydrochloride Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin hydrochloride is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmax is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin hydrochloride pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. JARDIAMET treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. Body Mass Index (BMI) Empagliflozin No dosage adjustment is necessary based on BMI. Body mass index had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Gender Empagliflozin No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin hydrochloride Metformin hydrochloride pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes when analysed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, the antihyperglycaemic effect of metformin hydrochloride was comparable in males and females. Race Empagliflozin No dosage adjustment is necessary based on race. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, AUC was estimated to be 13.5% higher in Asian patients with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 compared to non-Asian patients with a BMI of 25 kg/m2. Metformin hydrochloride No studies of metformin hydrochloride pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin hydrochloride in patients with type 2 diabetes, the antihyperglycaemic effect was comparable in white (n=249), black (n=51) and Hispanic (n=24) patients. Renal impairment Empagliflozin (eGFR: patients with mild 60 - <90 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate (eGFR: In 30 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2), severe (eGFR: <30 mL/min/1.73m2) renal impairment and patients with kidney failure/ESRD patients, AUC of empagliflozin increased by approximately 18%, 20%, 66%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were similar in subjects with moderate renal impairment and kidney failure/ESRD compared to patients with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were roughly 20% higher in subjects with mild and severe renal impairment as JARDIAMET PI0157-19 40 compared to subjects with normal renal function. In line with the Phase I study, the population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the apparent oral clearance of empagliflozin decreased with a decrease in drug exposure. Based on pharmacokinetics, no dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment. in eGFR increase leading to an Metformin hydrochloride In patients with decreased renal function (based on measured creatinine clearance), the plasma and blood half-life of metformin hydrochloride is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance. Hepatic impairment Empagliflozin In subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment according to the Child-Pugh classification, AUC of empagliflozin increased approximately by 23%, 47%, and 75% and Cmax by approximately 4%, 23%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Based on pharmacokinetics, no dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. Metformin hydrochloride No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride have been conducted in subjects with hepatic impairment. 5.3 PRECLINICAL SAFETY DATA Genotoxicity Empagliflozin Empagliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of genotoxicity studies, including the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay (bacterial reverse mutation), in vitro mouse lymphoma tk assays and in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. Metformin hydrochloride There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative. Carcinogenicity Empagliflozin Two-year oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. There was an increase in renal adenomas and carcinomas in male mice given empagliflozin at 1000 mg/kg/day. No renal tumours were seen at 300 mg/kg/day (11- and 28-times the exposure at the clinical dose of 12.5 and 5 mg twice daily, respectively). These tumours are likely associated with a metabolic pathway not present in humans, and are considered to be irrelevant to patients given clinical doses of empagliflozin. No drug-related tumours were seen in female mice or female rats at doses up to 1000 and 700 mg/kg/day, respectively, resulting in exposures at least 60 times that expected at the clinical dose of 5 or 12.5 mg empagliflozin lesions twice daily. (haemangiomas) of the mesenteric lymph node, were observed at 700 mg/kg/day, but not at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 26- and 65-times the exposure at the clinical dose of 12.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily, respectively). These tumours are common in rats and are unlikely to be relevant to humans. treatment-related benign vascular proliferative In male rats, JARDIAMET PI0157-19 41 Metformin hydrochloride Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day. 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 LIST OF EXCIPIENTS Each film-coated tablet of JARDIAMET contains the following inactive ingredients: copovidone, maize starch, colloidal anhydrous silica, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, macrogol 400, purified talc, iron oxide yellow (JARDIAMET 5 mg/500 mg, JARDIAMET 5 mg/850 mg, JARDIAMET 5 mg/1000 mg), iron oxide black (JARDIAMET 12.5 mg/500 mg, JARDIAMET 12.5 mg/850 mg, JARDIAMET 12.5 mg/1000 mg), iron oxide JARDIAMET (JARDIAMET red 12.5 mg/1000 mg). 12.5 mg/500 mg, 12.5 mg/850 mg, JARDIAMET 6.2 INCOMPATIBILITIES Incompatibilities were either not assessed or not identified as part of the registration of this medicine. 6.3 SHELF LIFE In Australia, information on the shelf life can be found on the public summary of the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).

Product details How do I use Jardiamet? 1. Why am I using Jardiamet? Jardiamet contains the active ingredient empagliflozin (which belongs to a group of medicines called SGLT2 (sodium-glucose co-transporter 2) inhibitors) and metformin hydrochloride (which belongs to a class of medicines called biguanides). Jardiamet is an anti- diabetes medicine where two different ingredients work together to control blood sugar levels by increasing the amount of glucose expelled in urine, and lowering the amount of sugar made by your body. Jardiamet is used to is used to lower blood sugar levels in adults and children aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It may be used when diet plus exercise do not provide adequate blood sugar level control either: ⦁ ⦁ alone as a single medicine, or in combination with certain other anti-diabetic medicines such as: sulfonylurea pioglitazone insulin linagliptin. ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ If you have type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, empagliflozin (one of the active ingredients in Jardiamet) can be used to reduce your risk of dying from your cardiovascular disease. 2. What should I know before I use Jardiamet? Warnings Do not use Jardiamet if you: ⦁ are allergic to empagliflozin or metformin hydrochloride (the active ingredients in Jardiamet), or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. Always check the ingredients to make sure you can use this medicine. Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include: shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, rash, itching or hives on the skin. ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ have any type of metabolic acidosis such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis (a symptom of uncontrolled diabetes, in which substances called ketone bodies build up in the blood - you may notice this as an unusual fruity odour on your breath, difficulty breathing, confusion and frequent urination) have had a diabetic pre-coma have problems with your kidneys have problems with your liver have a severe infection are dehydrated are treated for acute heart failure or have recently had a heart attack have severe problems with your circulation (such as shock) have severe breathing difficulties have blood clots in the lungs (symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain and a fast heart rate) have significant blood loss have gangrene have inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), symptoms include severe upper stomach pain, often with nausea and vomiting drink excessive alcohol (all the time or \"binge\" drinking). Talk to your doctor about when to stop taking Jardiamet and when to start taking it again if you: ⦁ ⦁ are going to have an X-ray where you will be injected with an iodinated contrast (dye) are planning to have surgery (including where the use of insulin is essential). Discard any other medicines containing metformin or empagliflozin that your doctor might have prescribed to Jardiamet CMI0158-16 2 you in the past and that you may still have in your possession. Jardiamet contains empagliflozin and metformin. If you have more than one metformin-containing medicine in your possession you may accidentally take too much (overdose). Accidentally taking too much metformin can cause a very serious side effect called lactic acidosis. ACCIDENTAL METFORMIN OVERDOSING IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY RISK. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure if you have any other medicines containing metformin. Metformin is sold under many different brand names in Australia. Your doctor or pharmacist will know which other medicines also contain metformin. Tell your doctor if you: ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ have allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes. have type 1 diabetes, a condition where your body does not produce insulin. Jardiamet should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes. are sick, have diarrhoea or fever, or if you are not able to eat or drink. These conditions can cause dehydration. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking Jardiamet until you recover to prevent loss of too much body fluid. have a serious infection of the kidney or the urinary tract with fever. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking Jardiamet until you have recovered. have heart problems, history of low blood pressure, or are 75 years of age or older. Increased passing of urine due to the medicine may affect fluid balance in your body and increase your risk of dehydration. are 85 years of age or older. You should not start taking Jardiamet if you are over 85 years of age. During treatment, you may be at risk of developing certain side effects. It is important you understand these risks and how to monitor for them. See additional information under Section 6. Are there any side effects? Pregnancy and breastfeeding Do not take this medicine if you are pregnant or intending to become pregnant. It may affect your developing baby if you take it during pregnancy.

Your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator can tell you what to do if you are taking any of these medicines. They also have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine. 4. How do I use Jardiamet? How to take it Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet. If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help. How much to take ⦁ ⦁ Take Jardiamet exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Your doctor will tell you how many Jardiamet tablets to take and how often you should take them. The usual dose is one Jardiamet tablet twice a day. ⦁ When to take Jardiamet ⦁ ⦁ Swallow the tablets whole with a full glass of water during or after meals. This will lessen the chance of a stomach upset. Jardiamet should be used about the same time each day. Taking it at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take it. If you forget to use Jardiamet Jardiamet should be used regularly at the same time each day. If you miss your dose at the usual time, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose you missed. ⦁ This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist. If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints. If you use too much Jardiamet ⦁ ⦁ contact your doctor, or go to the Emergency Department at your nearest hospital. You should do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. 5. What should I know while using Jardiamet? Things you should do If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor, dentist, and pharmacist that you are taking Jardiamet. Talk to your doctor about when to stop taking Jardiamet and when to start taking it again if you are about to have surgery or an examination such as an X-ray or scan requiring an injection of iodinated contrast (dye). If you are intending to become pregnant or are pregnant talk to your doctor about alternative medications to control your blood glucose level. It is important your blood glucose levels are as close to normal as possible at this time. If you are about to have any blood tests, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine. It may interfere with the results of some tests. Keep all of your doctor's appointments so that your progress can be checked. Your doctor may want to perform blood tests to check your kidneys and vitamin B12 levels while you are taking Jardiamet. Follow your doctor's and/or dietician's advice on diet, drinking alcohol and exercise. Diet and exercise can help your body use its blood sugar better. It is important to stay on the diet and exercise program recommended by your doctor while taking Jardiamet. Make sure you check your blood glucose regularly. This is the best way to tell if your diabetes is being controlled properly. Your doctor or diabetes educator will show you how and when to do this. Check your feet regularly and see your doctor if you notice any problems. Follow any other advice regarding foot care given by your doctor. Tell your doctor if you become ill or dehydrated, or experience stress, injury, fever, infection, or need surgery. Your blood glucose may become difficult to control at these times. You may also be at greater risk of developing a serious condition called lactic acidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis. During these times, your doctor may temporarily replace Jardiamet with insulin. Make sure that you, your friends, family and work colleagues can recognise the symptoms of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels) and hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels) and know how to treat them. If you think that you have used too much Jardiamet, you may need urgent medical attention. Things you should not do You should immediately: ⦁ phone the Poisons Information Centre (by calling 13 11 26), or Jardiamet CMI0158-16 ⦁ Do not stop using this medicine suddenly or lower the dosage without checking with your doctor. 4 ⦁ ⦁ Do not take Jardiamet to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to. Do not give your medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you. Hypoglycaemia Jardiamet does not normally cause hypoglycaemia, although you may experience it if you take certain other medicines. Signs of hypoglycaemia may include: ⦁ weakness, trembling or shaking ⦁ ⦁ sweating light-headedness, dizziness, headache or lack of concentration irritability, tearfulness or crying hunger numbness around the lips and tongue. ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ If not treated quickly, these symptoms may progress to: loss of co-ordination slurred speech confusion fits or loss of consciousness. ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ At the first signs of hypoglycaemia, you need to raise your blood glucose quickly. You can do this by taking one of the following: 5-7 jelly beans 3 teaspoons of sugar or honey half a can of non-diet soft drink 2-3 concentrated glucose tablets. ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ Unless you are within 10 to 15 minutes of your next meal or snack, follow up with extra carbohydrates such as plain biscuits, fruit or milk. Taking this extra carbohydrate will prevent a second drop in your blood glucose level. Also be careful when doing any of the following things, which may increase the risk of your blood glucose becoming too low: drinking alcohol not eating enough doing unexpected or vigorous exercise. ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ Hyperglycaemia If you notice the return of any signs of hyperglycaemia, contact your doctor immediately. The risk of hyperglycaemia is increased in the following situations: uncontrolled diabetes illness, infection or stress taking less Jardiamet than prescribed taking certain other medicines too little exercise eating more carbohydrates than normal. ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ Driving or using machines Be careful before you drive or use any machines or tools until you know how Jardiamet affects you. Jardiamet may cause dizziness in some people when taken with other anti-diabetic medicines, such as sulfonylurea or insulin, as your risk of getting low blood sugar is higher. This may cause dizziness, light-headedness, tiredness, drowsiness in some people. Low blood glucose levels may also slow your reaction time and affect your ability to drive or operate machinery. If you have any of these symptoms, do not drive, operate machinery or do anything else that could be dangerous. Drinking alcohol Tell your doctor if you drink alcohol. Alcohol may increase the risk of your blood glucose becoming too low. Looking after your medicine ⦁ ⦁ Keep your tablets in the pack until it is time to take them. If you take the tablets out of the pack they may not keep well. Keep your tablets in a cool dry place where the temperature stays below 30°C. Follow the instructions in the carton on how to take care of your medicine properly. Store it in a cool dry place away from moisture, heat or sunlight; for example, do not store it: in the bathroom or near a sink, or in the car or on window sills. ⦁ ⦁ Heat and dampness can destroy some medicines. Keep it where young children cannot reach it. A locked cupboard at least one-and-a-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines. Getting rid of any unwanted medicine If you no longer need to use this medicine or it is out of date, take it to any pharmacy for safe disposal."}

For the full list of excipients, see Section 6.1 List of excipients. 3 PHARMACEUTICAL FORM GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg film-coated tablets are pale yellow, arc triangular, flat-faced, bevel- edged, film-coated tablets. One side is debossed with the Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol, the other side is debossed with “10/5”. GLYXAMBI 25 mg/5 mg film-coated tablets are pale pink, arc triangular, flat-faced, bevel- edged, film-coated tablets. One side is debossed with the Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol, the other side is debossed with “25/5”. 4 CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS GLYXAMBI tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both empagliflozin and linagliptin is appropriate (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration and 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties – Clinical trials). 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION The recommended starting dose is GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg (empagliflozin 10 mg / linagliptin 5 mg) once daily. In patients tolerating GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg once daily and requiring additional glycaemic control, the dose can be increased to GLYXAMBI 25 mg/5 mg (empagliflozin 25 mg / linagliptin 5 mg) once daily. In patients already on empagliflozin, the dose of GLYXAMBI should provide the dose of empagliflozin similar to the dose already been taken by the patient. GLYXAMBI can be taken with or without food and at any time of day. Combination therapy When GLYXAMBI is used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see Sections 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions and 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Patients with renal impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of empagliflozin and periodically thereafter. Glycaemic control is reduced in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. GLYXAMBI is contraindicated in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 1 Therapeutic experience with GLYXAMBI is limited in patients with eGFR <60 mL/min. No dose adjustment is required for patients with eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see Sections 4.3 Contraindications and 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Elderly Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age. Therapeutic experience in patients aged 75 years and older is limited. Initiation of GLYXAMBI therapy in this population is not recommended (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Patients aged 75 years and older should be prescribed with caution (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Paediatric population The safety and effectiveness of GLYXAMBI in children below 18 years of age have not been established. GLYXAMBI is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to empagliflozin or linagliptin or any of the excipients. Patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30mL/min/1.73m2), end-stage renal disease and patients on dialysis. The efficacy of empagliflozin is dependent on renal function (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE General GLYXAMBI should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes (see Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications). Diabetic ketoacidosis GLYXAMBI should not be used for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalisation, have been reported in postmarketing surveillance in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking empagliflozin. Patients treated with GLYXAMBI who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels as ketoacidosis associated with GLYXAMBI may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 13.8 mmol/L. Signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis may include excessive thirst, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalised malaise, and shortness of breath. If ketoacidosis is suspected, GLYXAMBI should be discontinued, the patient should be evaluated and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis generally requires insulin, fluid, potassium and carbohydrate replacement. Diabetic ketoacidosis and glucosuria may be prolonged after discontinuation of GLYXAMBI in some patients, i.e. it may last longer than expected from 5 plasma half-lives of empagliflozin (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 2 Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved. Before initiating GLYXAMBI, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis. Factors that predispose patients to ketoacidosis include a low carbohydrate diet , dehydration, acute illness, surgery, a previous ketoacidosis, insulin deficiency from any cause (including insulin pump failure, history of pancreatitis, or pancreatic surgery), malnourishment/reduced caloric intake or increased insulin requirements due to infections, and alcohol abuse. GLYXAMBI should be used with caution in these patients. When reducing the insulin dose in patients requiring insulin, caution should be taken (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of temporarily discontinuing administration). Consider monitoring GLYXAMBI in clinical situations known to predispose ketoacidosis. In these situations, consider monitoring of ketones, even if GLYXAMBI treatment has been interrupted. for ketoacidosis and Surgery Treatment with GLYXAMBI should be ceased prior to major surgery. An increase in other glucose lowering agents may be required during this time. Patients scheduled for non-urgent surgery who have not ceased empagliflozin should be assessed and consideration should be given to postponing the procedure. Treatment with GLYXAMBI may be restarted once the patient's condition has stabilised and oral intake is normal. Hypoglycaemia In clinical trials of linagliptin or of empagliflozin as part of combination therapy with agents not known to cause hypoglycaemia (e.g. metformin, thiazolidinediones) rates of hypoglycaemia reported with linagliptin or empagliflozin were similar to rates in patients taking placebo (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Sulfonylureas and insulin are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, caution is advised when GLYXAMBI is used in combination with a sulfonylurea and/or insulin. A dose reduction of the sulfonylurea or insulin may be considered. Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been observed in patients taking linagliptin (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). If pancreatitis is suspected, GLYXAMBI should be discontinued. Use in patients at risk for volume depletion Based on the mode of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, osmotic diuresis accompanying therapeutic glucosuria may lead to a modest decrease in BP. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients for whom an empagliflozin-induced drop in BP could pose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension or patients aged 75 years and older. In case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, BP measurements, laboratory tests including haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving empagliflozin. Temporary interruption of treatment with GLYXAMBI should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected. Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalisation in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 3 empagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Discontinuation of empagliflozin may be considered in cases of recurrent urinary tract infections. Genital infections including life threatening necrotising fasciitis Cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier’s gangrene), a rare, but serious and life-threatening necrotising infection, have been reported in female and male patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Serious outcomes have included hospitalisation, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with GLYXAMBI who present with pain or tenderness, erythema, swelling in the genital or perineal area, fever, malaise should be evaluated for necrotising fasciitis. If suspected, GLYXAMBI should be discontinued and prompt treatment should be instituted (including broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement if necessary). Lower limb amputations An increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in a long-term clinical study with another SGLT2 inhibitor. The medicine in that study is not empagliflozin. However, it is unknown whether this constitutes a class effect. In a pooled safety analysis of 12,620 patients with T2DM the frequency of patients with lower limb amputations was similar between empagliflozin and placebo. In the largest placebo-controlled trial in 7020 patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial), in which 88% of all the cases of amputations were reported, lower limb amputations occurred in 1.8% of patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg, in 2.0% of patients treated with empagliflozin 25 mg, and in 1.8% of patients in the placebo arm. It is important to regularly examine the feet and counsel all diabetic patients on routine preventative footcare. Bullous pemphigoid Bullous pemphigoid has been observed in patients taking linagliptin. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, GLYXAMBI should be discontinued. Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of joint pain, which may be severe, in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Onset of symptoms following initiation of treatment may be rapid or may occur after longer periods. Discontinuation of therapy should be considered in patients who present with or experience an exacerbation of joint symptoms during treatment with linagliptin. Combination with glucagon like peptide (GLP-1) analogues Linagliptin has not been studied in combination with glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues. Use in renal impairment Empagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable Effects)). Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating empagliflozin. Patients with hypovolaemia may be more susceptible to these changes. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalisation and dialysis, in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age. GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 4 GLYXAMBI is contraindicated for use in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration – Patients with renal impairment and 4.3 Contraindications). Therapeutic experience with GLYXAMBI is limited in patients with eGFR <60 mL/min. Monitoring of renal function Due to its mechanism of action, the efficacy of empagliflozin is dependent on renal function. Therefore assessment of renal function is recommended: • prior to empagliflozin initiation and periodically during treatment, i.e. at least yearly; • prior to initiation of concomitant medicines that may reduce renal function and periodically thereafter. Patients treated with empagliflozin can experience an initial fall in eGFR. More intensive monitoring of renal function is recommended, particularly following treatment initiation, if empagliflozin is used in patients with an eGFR"}

There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalisation and dialysis, in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age. GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 4 GLYXAMBI is contraindicated for use in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration – Patients with renal impairment and 4.3 Contraindications). Therapeutic experience with GLYXAMBI is limited in patients with eGFR <60 mL/min. Monitoring of renal function Due to its mechanism of action, the efficacy of empagliflozin is dependent on renal function. Therefore assessment of renal function is recommended: • prior to empagliflozin initiation and periodically during treatment, i.e. at least yearly; • prior to initiation of concomitant medicines that may reduce renal function and periodically thereafter. Patients treated with empagliflozin can experience an initial fall in eGFR. More intensive monitoring of renal function is recommended, particularly following treatment initiation, if empagliflozin is used in patients with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, especially if the eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2. GLYXAMBI should be discontinued when the eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl <30 mL/min (see Section 4.3 Contraindications). Use in the elderly Patients aged 75 years and older may be at increased risk of volume depletion, therefore, GLYXAMBI should be prescribed with caution in these patients (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Therapeutic experience in patients aged 75 years and older is limited. Initiation of therapy with GLYXAMBI in this population is not recommended. Paediatric use The safety and effectiveness of GLYXAMBI in children below 18 years of age have not been established. GLYXAMBI is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. Effect on laboratory tests Urine will test positive for glucose while patients are taking GLYXAMBI due to the nature of the mechanism of action of the SGLT2 inhibitors (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties). Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5- AG are unreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycaemic control. 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS No interactions between the two components of this fixed-dose combination have been observed in clinical studies. No drug interaction studies have been performed with GLYXAMBI and other medicinal products, however, such studies have been conducted with the individual active substances. No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic interactions were observed when empagliflozin or linagliptin were co-administered with other commonly used medicinal products. Based on results of pharmacokinetic studies, no dose adjustment of GLYXAMBI is recommended when (see Section 5.1 co-administered with commonly prescribed medicinal products Pharmacodynamic properties), except those mentioned below. GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 5 Insulin and sulfonylureas: Insulin and sulfonylureas may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or sulfonylureas may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with GLYXAMBI (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration, 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Diuretics: Empagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Lithium: Empagliflozin may increase renal lithium excretion and the blood lithium levels may be decreased. Serum concentration of lithium should be monitored more frequently after empagliflozin initiation and dose changes. Please refer the patient to the lithium prescribing doctor in order to monitor serum concentration of lithium. UGT inhibitors and inducers: Empagliflozin is primarily metabolised via UGT (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties); however, a clinically relevant effect of UGT inhibitors on empagliflozin is not expected. Rifampicin: A study was conducted to assess the effect of rifampicin, a potent inductor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, on linagliptin. Multiple co-administration of linagliptin with rifampicin, resulted in a 39.6% and 43.8% decreased linagliptin steady-state AUC and Cmax and about 30% decreased DPP-4 inhibition at trough. Thus linagliptin in combination with strong P-glycoprotein inducers is expected to be clinically efficacious, although full efficacy might not be achieved. the pharmacokinetics of 5 mg Ritonavir: A study was conducted to assess the effect of ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of P- glycoprotein and CYP3A4, on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin. Co-administration of a single 5 mg oral dose of linagliptin and multiple 200 mg oral doses of ritonavir increased the AUC and Cmax of linagliptin approximately two-fold and three-fold, respectively. Simulations of steady-state plasma concentrations of linagliptin with and without ritonavir indicated that the increase in exposure will not be associated with an increased accumulation. These changes in linagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions would not be expected with other P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 inhibitors and dose adjustment is not required. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on fertility No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for GLYXAMBI or with the individual components. Animal studies conducted with empagliflozin alone and linagliptin alone do not indicate adverse effects on fertility in patients. Empagliflozin Studies in rats at doses of empagliflozin up to 700 mg/kg/day, do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. In female rats this dose was 90- and 155-fold the systemic AUC exposure anticipated with a human dose of 10 and 25 mg. Linagliptin No adverse effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats given linagliptin orally up to the highest dose of 240 mg/kg/day (yielding approximately 1,000 times the plasma AUC obtained in patients at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 5 mg/day) prior to and throughout mating. GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 6 Use in pregnancy (Category D) There is a limited amount of data from the use of empagliflozin and linagliptin in pregnant women. It is recommended to avoid the use of GLYXAMBI during pregnancy unless clearly needed. In a study in pregnant rats, oral co-administration of 700 mg/kg empagliflozin and 140 mg/kg linagliptin during the period of organogenesis was associated with decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of minor fetal skeletal abnormalities, occurring in conjunction with maternotoxicity. No adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed with administration of 300 mg/kg empagliflozin and 60 mg/kg linagliptin in combination, yielding approximately 100 and 230 times the exposure to empagliflozin and linagliptin in patients at the maximum recommended human dose. Empagliflozin Empagliflozin administered during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg in the rat or rabbit, which corresponds to approximately 48- and 122-times or 128- and 325-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin based on AUC exposure associated with the 25 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively. Doses of empagliflozin causing maternal toxicity in the rat also caused the malformation of bent limb bones at exposures approximately 155- and 393-times the clinical dose associated with the 25 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively. Maternally toxic doses in the rabbit also caused increased embryofetal loss at doses approximately 139- and 353-times the clinical dose associated with the 25 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively. Empagliflozin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20 resulted in reduced weight gain in offspring at >30 mg/kg/day maternal exposures approximately 4- and 11-times those seen with a clinical dose of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively. No adverse effects on postnatal development were noted at 10 mg/kg/day (maternal exposures approximately equivalent to those seen with a clinical dose of 25 mg). Specialised studies in rats with other members of the pharmacological class have shown toxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to the second and third trimesters of human pregnancy. Similar effects have been seen for empagliflozin at approximately 11 times the clinical AUC exposure associated with the 25 mg dose. These findings were absent after a 13 week drug-free recovery period. Linagliptin Linagliptin was shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits. In animal embryofetal development studies, linagliptin was shown to be not teratogenic in rats at oral doses up to 240 mg/kg/day (approximately 1,000 times the exposure in patients at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC) and up to 150 mg/kg/day in the rabbit (approximately 2,000 times human exposure). However, postimplantation loss was increased in both species at these upper dose levels (together with maternotoxicity), and there was an increase in runts and a slight increase in the incidence of fetal visceral variations in the rabbit. No adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed at up to 30 mg/kg/day in the rat (50 times human exposure) and up to 25 mg/kg/day in the rabbit (78 times human exposure). Use in lactation No data in humans are available on excretion of empagliflozin and linagliptin into milk. Available nonclinical data in animals have shown excretion of empagliflozin and linagliptin and its metabolites in milk. It is recommended to discontinue breast feeding during treatment with GLYXAMBI. Empagliflozin GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 7 Reduced body weight was observed in rats exposed to empagliflozin in utero and through the consumption of maternal milk (see Use in pregnancy). Adverse effects on renal development have been observed in juvenile rats treated with other members of this pharmacological class. Similar effects were seen with empagliflozin but the findings were absent after a 13 week drug- free recovery. A risk to human newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Linagliptin Linagliptin and its metabolites were shown to be readily excreted in the milk of lactating rats. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. If patients experience dizziness, they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery. 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Reporting suspected adverse effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important.

Description of selected adverse reactions The frequencies below are calculated for adverse reactions regardless of causality. Hypoglycaemia In pooled clinical trials of GLYXAMBI in patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control on background metformin, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycaemic events was low (<1.5%; for confirmed clinical events per trial see Table 2). One patient administered GLYXAMBI experienced a confirmed (investigator-defined), major hypoglycaemic event in the active- or placebo-controlled trials and none required assistance.

The frequency of patients with hypoglycaemia was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo when given as add-on to metformin plus sulfonylurea, and as add-on to insulin +/- metformin and +/- sulfonylurea. Major hypoglycaemia with empagliflozin (events requiring assistance) The frequency of patients with major hypoglycaemic events was low (<1%) and similar for empagliflozin and placebo as monotherapy, as add-on to metformin +/- sulfonylurea, and as add-on to pioglitazone +/- metformin. The frequency of patients with major hypoglycaemic events was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo when given as add-on to insulin +/- metformin and +/- sulfonylurea. Hypoglycaemia with linagliptin The most frequently reported adverse event in clinical trials with linagliptin was hypoglycaemia observed under the triple combination, linagliptin plus metformin plus sulfonylurea (22.9% vs 14.8% in placebo). Hypoglycaemias in the placebo-controlled studies (10.9%; n=471) were mild (80%; n=384) or moderate (16.6%; n=78) or severe (1.9%; n=9) in intensity). Urinary tract infection In clinical trials with GLYXAMBI, the frequency of urinary tract infection adverse events (GLYXAMBI 25 mg/5 mg: 9.2%; GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg: 8.8%) has been comparable to those reported from the empagliflozin clinical trials. In empagliflozin trials, the overall frequency of urinary tract infection was similar in patients treated with empagliflozin 25 mg (7.0%) and placebo (7.2%), and higher in patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg (8.8%). Similar to placebo, urinary tract infection was reported more frequently for empagliflozin in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections. The intensity of urinary tract infections was similar to placebo for mild, moderate, and severe intensity reports. Urinary tract infection events were reported more frequently for empagliflozin compared to placebo in female patients, but not in male patients. Vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infection In clinical trials with GLYXAMBI, the frequency of genital infection adverse events (GLYXAMBI 25 mg/5 mg: 3.1%; GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg: 3.5%) has been comparable to those reported from the empagliflozin clinical trials. GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 11 In empagliflozin trials, vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infections were reported more frequently for empagliflozin 10 mg (4.0%) and empagliflozin 25 mg (3.9%) compared to placebo (1.0%). These adverse events were reported more frequently for empagliflozin compared to placebo in female patients, and the difference in frequency was less pronounced in male patients. The genital tract infections were mild and moderate in intensity, none was severe in intensity. Cases of phimosis/ acquired phimosis have been reported concurrent with genital infections. Increased urination In clinical trials with GLYXAMBI, the frequency of increased urination adverse events (GLYXAMBI 25 mg/5 mg: 1.7%; GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg: 0.8%) has been comparable to those reported from the empagliflozin clinical trials. As expected via its mechanism of action, in clinical trials with empagliflozin, increased urination (as assessed by preferred term search including pollakiuria, polyuria, nocturia) was observed at higher frequencies in patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg (3.5%) and empagliflozin 25 mg (3.3%) compared to placebo (1.4%). Increased urination was mostly mild or moderate in intensity. The frequency of reported nocturia was comparable between placebo and empagliflozin (<1%). Volume depletion In clinical trials with GLYXAMBI, the frequency of patients with volume depletion adverse events (GLYXAMBI 25 mg/5 mg: 0.6%; GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg: 0.5%) has been comparable to those reported from the empagliflozin clinical trials. In clinical trials with empagliflozin, the overall frequency of patients with volume depletion (including the predefined terms BP (ambulatory) decreased, SBP decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolaemia, orthostatic hypotension and syncope) was similar to placebo (0.6% for empagliflozin 10 mg, 0.4% for empagliflozin 25 mg and 0.3% for placebo). The effect of empagliflozin on urinary glucose excretion is associated with osmotic diuresis, which could affect hydration status of patients age 75 years and older. In patients ≥75 years of age the frequency of patients with volume depletion events was similar for empagliflozin 10 mg (2.3%) compared to placebo (2.1%), but it increased with empagliflozin 25 mg (4.3%). Blood creatinine increased and glomerular filtration rate decreased Use of empagliflozin was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR. These changes were observed to reverse after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute haemodynamic changes play a role in the renal function abnormalities observed with empagliflozin. Renal-related adverse reactions (e.g. acute kidney injury, renal impairment, acute prerenal failure) may occur in patients treated with empagliflozin. In clinical trials with GLYXAMBI, the frequency of patients with increased blood creatinine (GLYXAMBI 25 mg/5 mg: 0.4%; GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg: 0%) and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GLYXAMBI 25 mg/5 mg: 0.4%; GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg: 0.6%) has been comparable to those reported from the empagliflozin clinical trials. Laboratory parameters Haematocrit increased In clinical trials with GLYXAMBI, mean changes from baseline in haematocrit were 2.9% and 3.2% for GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg and 25 mg/5 mg. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, haematocrit values returned towards baseline values after a follow-up period of 30 days after treatment stop.

During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg empagliflozin, equivalent to 32 times the daily recommended dose, were well tolerated. During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 600 mg linagliptin (equivalent to 120 times the recommended dose) were well tolerated. There is no experience with doses above 600 mg in humans. Treatment In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g. remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring and institute clinical measures as required. The removal of empagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied. 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Pharmacotherapeutic group: Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering drugs, ATC code: A10BD19. Mechanism of action Combination empagliflozin/linagliptin Empagliflozin and linagliptin act by separate and complementary mechanisms to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (TD2M). The combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin, after single oral dosing, showed a superior effect on glycaemic control (oral glucose tolerance test) as compared to the respective monotherapies tested in diabetic ZDF rats. Empagliflozin Empagliflozin is a reversible competitive inhibitor of SGLT2 with an IC50 of 1.3 nM. It has a 5000-fold selectivity over human SGLT1 (IC50 of 6278 nM), responsible for glucose absorption in the gut. SGLT2 is highly expressed in the kidney, whereas expression in other tissues is absent or very low. It is responsible as the predominant transporter for re-absorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. In patients with T2DM and hyperglycaemia a higher amount of glucose is filtered and reabsorbed. Empagliflozin improves glycaemic control in patients with T2DM by reducing renal glucose re- absorption. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Through inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with T2DM and hyperglycaemia, excess glucose is excreted in the urine. In patients with T2DM, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following the first dose of empagliflozin and is continuous over the 24 hour dosing interval. Increased urinary glucose excretion was maintained at the end of 4-week treatment period, averaging approximately GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 13 78 g/day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily. Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in plasma glucose levels in patients with T2DM. Empagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels. The insulin independent mechanism of action of empagliflozin contributes to a low risk of hypoglycaemia. The effect of empagliflozin in lowering blood glucose is independent of beta cell function and insulin pathway. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell function including Homeostasis Model Assessment-β (HOMA-β) and proinsulin to insulin ratio were noted. In addition urinary glucose excretion triggers calorie loss, associated with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The glucosuria observed with empagliflozin is accompanied by mild diuresis which may contribute to sustained and moderate reduction of blood pressure (BP). Linagliptin Linagliptin is an inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 an enzyme which is involved in the inactivation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP (glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). These hormones are rapidly degraded by the enzyme DPP-4. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretins are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Linagliptin binding to DPP-4 is reversible but long lasting and thus leads to a sustained increase and a prolongation of active incretin levels. In vitro, linagliptin inhibits DPP- 4 with nanomolar potency and exhibits a >10000 fold selectivity versus DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity. Clinical trials A total of 2173 patients with T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control were treated in clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GLYXAMBI; 1005 patients were treated with empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg, and linagliptin 5 mg. In clinical trials, patients were treated for up to 24 or 52 weeks. GLYXAMBI added to metformin In a factorial design study, patients inadequately controlled on metformin (mean daily dose 1889.0 (± 470.9) mg at baseline), 24-weeks treatment with GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg and GLYXAMBI 25 mg/5 mg provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to linagliptin 5 mg alone and also compared to empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg alone. Compared to linagliptin 5 mg GLYXAMBI provided statistically significant improvements in body weight. A greater proportion of patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥7.0% and treated with GLYXAMBI achieved a target HbA1c of <7% compared to the individual components (Table 3). After 24 weeks’ treatment with GLYXAMBI, both systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) were reduced, -5.6/-3.6 mmHg (p<0.001 versus linagliptin 5 mg for SBP and DBP) for GLYXAMBI 25 mg/ 5 mg and -4.1/-2.6 mmHg (p<0.05 versus linagliptin 5 mg for SBP, n.s. for DBP) for GLYXAMBI 10 mg/ 5 mg. Clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c (Table 3) and both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed at week 52, -3.8/-1.6 mmHg (p<0.05 versus linagliptin 5 mg for SBP and DBP) for GLYXAMBI 25 mg/ 5 mg and -3.1/-1.6 mmHg (p<0.05 versus linagliptin 5 mg for SBP, n.s. for DBP) for GLYXAMBI 10 mg/ 5 mg. GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 14 After 24 weeks, rescue therapy was used in 1 (0.7%) patient treated with GLYXAMBI 25 mg/5 mg and in 3 (2.2%) patients treated with GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg, compared to 4 (3.1%) patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg and 6 (4.3%) patients treated with empagliflozin 25 mg and 1 (0.7%) patient treated with empagliflozin 10 mg.

A statistically significantly GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 19 greater proportion of patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥7.0% and treated with the empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg achieved a target HbA1c of <7% compared to placebo/empagliflozin 10 mg (Table 6). After 24 weeks’ treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similar to placebo/empagliflozin 10 mg (n.s. for SBP and DBP). After 24 weeks, rescue therapy was used in 2 (1.6%) patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg and in 5 (4.0%) patients treated with placebo/empagliflozin 10 mg. In a pre-specified subgroup of patients (n=66) with baseline HbA1c greater or equal than 8.5%, the reduction from baseline in HbA1c empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg (n=31) was -0.97% at 24 weeks (p=0.0875 versus placebo/empagliflozin 10 mg). Linagliptin 5 mg in patients inadequately controlled on empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin In patients inadequately controlled on empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin (mean daily dose 2003.9 (± 438.8) mg at baseline), 24-weeks treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and FPG compared to placebo/empagliflozin 25 mg. Compared to placebo/empagliflozin 25 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg provided similar results on body weight. A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥7.0% and treated with the empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg achieved a target HbA1c of <7% compared to placebo/empagliflozin 25 mg (Table 6). After 24 weeks’ treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were similar to placebo/empagliflozin 25 mg (n.s. for SBP and DBP). After 24 weeks, rescue therapy was used in 0 (0.0%) patients treated with empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg and in 3 (2.7%) patients treated with placebo/empagliflozin 25 mg. In a pre-specified subgroup of patients (n=42) with baseline HbA1c greater or equal than 8.5%, the reduction from baseline in HbA1c with empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg (n=20) was -1.16% at 24 weeks (p=0.0046 versus placebo+empagliflozin 25 mg).

This result was driven by a significant reduction in CV death, with no significant change in non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. In the CARMELINA study, linagliptin did not increase the risk of the combined endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (MACE-3) [Hazard Ratio (HR)=1.02; (95% CI 0.89, 1.17); p=0.0002 for non-inferiority], or the risk of combined endpoint of renal death, ESRD, 40% or more sustained decrease in eGFR [HR=1.04; (95% CI 0.89, 1.22)], when added to standard of care in adult patients with T2DM with increased CV risk evidenced by a history of established macrovascular or renal disease. In addition, linagliptin did not increase the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure [HR=0.90; (95% CI 0.74, 1.08)]. No increased risk of CV death or all-cause mortality was observed. Safety data from this study was in line with previous known safety profile of linagliptin. Linagliptin cardiovascular safety study (CAROLINA) CAROLINA was a randomised study in 6033 patients with early type 2 diabetes and increased CV risk or established complications who were treated with linagliptin 5 mg (3023) or glimepiride 1–4 mg (3010) added to standard of care (including background therapy with metformin in 83% of patients) targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. The mean age for study population was 64 years and included 2030 (34%) patients ≥ 70 years of age. The study population included 2089 (35%) patients with cardiovascular disease and 1130 (19%) patients with renal impairment with an eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline. The mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.15%. The study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority for the primary cardiovascular endpoint which was a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death or a non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a non-fatal stroke (3P-MACE). GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 21 After a median follow up of 6.25 years, linagliptin did not increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (Table 7) as compared to glimepiride. Results were consistent for patients treated with or without metformin.

There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of GLYXAMBI’s effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 5.2 PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES The rate and extent of absorption of empagliflozin and in GLYXAMBI (empagliflozin/linagliptin) are equivalent to the bioavailability of empagliflozin and linagliptin when administered as individual tablets. linagliptin The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin and linagliptin have been extensively characterised in healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM. No clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics were seen between healthy volunteers and T2DM patients. The following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of GLYXAMBI. Absorption Empagliflozin The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin have been extensively characterised in healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM. After oral administration, empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) with a median Cmax, (tmax) of 1.5 h post-dose. Thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow terminal phase. The steady state mean plasma area under the curve (AUC) was 4740 nmol·h/L and Cmax was 687 nmol/L with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily. Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner. The single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics parameters of empagliflozin were similar suggesting linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time. There were no clinically relevant differences in empagliflozin pharmacokinetics between healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM. GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 22 Administration of 25 mg empagliflozin after intake of a high-fat and high calorie meal resulted in slightly lower exposure; AUC decreased by approximately 16% and Cmax decreased by approximately 37%, compared to fasted condition.

The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not considered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food. Linagliptin The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin has been extensively characterised in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. After oral administration of a 5 mg dose to healthy volunteer patients, linagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1.5 hours post-dose. Plasma concentrations of linagliptin decline in a triphasic manner with a long terminal half-life (terminal half-life for linagliptin more than 100 hours), that is mostly related to the saturable, tight binding of linagliptin to DPP-4 and does not contribute to the accumulation of the drug. The effective half-life for accumulation of linagliptin, as determined from oral administration of multiple doses of 5 mg linagliptin, is approximately 12 hours. After once-daily dosing, steady- state plasma concentrations of 5 mg linagliptin are reached by the third dose. Plasma area under the curve (AUC) of linagliptin increased approximately 33% following 5 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for linagliptin AUC were small (12.6% and 28.5%, respectively). Plasma AUC of linagliptin increased in a less than dose-proportional manner. The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. The absolute bioavailability of linagliptin is approximately 30%. Because co-administration of a high-fat meal with linagliptin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics, linagliptin may be administered with or without food. In vitro studies indicated that linagliptin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and of CYP3A4. Ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, led to a two-fold increase in exposure (AUC) and multiple co-administration of linagliptin with rifampicin, a potent inducer of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A, resulted in an approximate 40% decreased linagliptin steady- state AUC, presumably by increasing/decreasing the bioavailability of linagliptin by inhibition/induction of P-glycoprotein. Distribution Empagliflozin The apparent steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73.8 L, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects, the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 36.8% and plasma protein binding was 86.2%. Linagliptin As a result of tissue binding, the mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state following a single 5 mg intravenous dose of linagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 1110 litres, indicating that linagliptin extensively distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is concentration-dependent, decreasing from about 99% at 1 nmol/L to 75-89% at ≥30 nmol/L, reflecting saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin. At the peak plasma concentration in humans at 5 mg/day, approximately 10% of linagliptin is unbound. Metabolism Empagliflozin No major metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in human plasma and the most abundant metabolites were three glucuronide conjugates (2-O-, 3-O-, and 6-O-glucuronide). Systemic GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 23 exposure of each metabolite was less than 10% of total drug-related material. In vitro studies suggested that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9. Linagliptin Following a [14C]-linagliptin oral 10 mg dose, only 5% of the radioactivity was excreted in urine. Metabolism plays a subordinate role in the elimination of linagliptin. One main metabolite with a relative exposure of 13.3% of linagliptin at steady state was detected and was found to be pharmacologically inactive and thus does not contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of linagliptin. Excretion Empagliflozin The apparent terminal elimination half-life of empagliflozin was estimated to be 12.4 h and apparent oral clearance was 10.6 L/h based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. The inter-subject and residual variabilities for empagliflozin oral clearance were 39.1% and 35.8%, respectively. With once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were reached by the fifth dose. Consistent with half-life, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to plasma AUC, was observed at steady-state. Following administration of an oral [14C]- empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects, approximately 95.6% of the drug related radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (41.2%) or urine (54.4%). The majority of drug related radioactivity recovered in faeces was unchanged parent drug and approximately half of drug- related radioactivity excreted in urine was unchanged parent drug. Linagliptin Following administration of an oral [14C]-linagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 85% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (80%) or urine (5%) within 4 days of dosing. Renal clearance at steady state was approximately 70 mL/min. Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups Pharmacokinetics in children Studies characterising the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin or linagliptin in paediatric patients have not been performed. Pharmacokinetics in the elderly Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin or linagliptin based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 78 years) had comparable plasma concentrations of linagliptin compared to younger subjects. Renal Impairment Based on pharmacokinetics, no dosage adjustment is recommended for GLYXAMBI in patients with renal impairment. Empagliflozin (eGFR: patients with mild 60 - <90 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate In (eGFR: 30 - <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe (eGFR: <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment and patients with kidney failure/end stage renal disease (ESRD), AUC of empagliflozin increased by approximately 18%, 20%, 66%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were similar in subjects with moderate renal impairment and kidney failure/ESRD compared to patients with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were roughly 20% higher in subjects with mild and severe renal impairment as compared to subjects with normal renal function. In line with the Phase I study, GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 24 the population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the apparent oral clearance of empagliflozin decreased with a decrease in eGFR leading to an increase in drug exposure. Based on pharmacokinetics, no dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment. Linagliptin A multiple-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin (5 mg dose) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to normal healthy control subjects. The study included patients with renal impairment classified on the basis of creatinine clearance as mild (50 to <80 mL/min), moderate (30 to <50 mL/min), and severe (<30 mL/min), as well as patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis. In addition, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min) were compared to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. Creatinine clearance was measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance measurements or estimated from serum creatinine based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula: CrCl = [140 - age (years)] x weight (kg) {x 0.85 for female patients} / [72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)]. Under steady-state conditions, linagliptin exposure in patients with mild renal impairment was comparable to healthy subjects. In moderate renal impairment, a moderate increase in exposure of about 1.7-fold was observed compared with control. Exposure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment was increased by about 1.4-fold compared to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. Steady-state predictions for AUC of linagliptin in patients with ESRD indicated comparable exposure to that of patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. In addition, linagliptin is not expected to be eliminated to a therapeutically significant degree by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, no dosage adjustment of linagliptin is necessary in patients with any degree of renal impairment. In addition, mild renal impairment had no effect on linagliptin pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as assessed by population pharmacokinetic analyses. Pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment Based on pharmacokinetics of the two individual components, no dosage adjustment of GLYXAMBI is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. Empagliflozin In subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment according to the Child-Pugh classification, AUC of empagliflozin increased approximately by 23%, 47%, and 75% and Cmax by approximately 4%, 23%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Linagliptin In patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic insufficiency (according to the Child-Pugh classification), mean AUC and Cmax of linagliptin were similar to healthy matched controls following administration of multiple 5 mg doses of linagliptin. Body Mass Index (BMI) No dosage adjustment is necessary for GLYXAMBI based on BMI. Body mass index had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin or linagliptin based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. Gender No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin or linagliptin based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 25 Race No dosage adjustment is necessary based on race. Empagliflozin Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, AUC was estimated to be 13.5% higher in Asian patients with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 compared to non-Asian patients with a BMI of 25 kg/m2. Linagliptin Race had no obvious effect on the plasma concentrations of linagliptin based on a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, including patients of Caucasian, Hispanic, African- American, and Asian origin. In addition the pharmacokinetic characteristics of linagliptin were found to be similar in dedicated phase I studies in Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian healthy volunteers and African American type 2 diabetes patients. 5.3 PRECLINICAL SAFETY DATA Genotoxicity No genotoxicity studies with the combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin have been performed. Empagliflozin Empagliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of genotoxicity studies, including the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay (bacterial reverse mutation), in vitro mouse lymphoma tk assays and in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. Linagliptin Linagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, and an in vivo micronucleus assay in the rat.

Carcinogenicity No carcinogenicity studies with the combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin have been performed. Empagliflozin Two-year oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. There was an increase in renal adenomas and carcinomas in male mice given empagliflozin at 1000 mg/kg/day. No renal tumours were seen at 300 mg/kg/day (11- and 28-times the exposure at the clinical dose of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively). These tumours are likely associated with a metabolic pathway not present in humans, and are considered to be irrelevant to patients given 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin. No drug-related tumours were seen in female mice or female rates at doses up to 1000 and 700 mg/kg/day, respectively, resulting in exposures at least 60 times that expected at the clinical dose of 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin. In male rats, treatment-related benign vascular proliferative lesions (haemangiomas) of the mesenteric lymph node, were observed at 700 mg/kg/day, but not at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 26- and 65-times the exposure at the clinical does of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively). These tumours are common in rats and are unlikely to be relevant to humans. Linagliptin No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed with linagliptin in 2-year studies in mice and rats given oral doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses correspond to approximately 300- and 400-times the human exposure (plasma AUC) at the MRHD of 5 mg/day.

ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ corrects this chemical imbalance and may help relieve the symptoms of depression.

If used during pregnancy ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ should never be stopped abruptly. Do not take ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ if you are breast- feeding unless you and your doctor have discussed the risks and benefits. It passes into breast milk and therefore there is a possibility that your baby may be affected. ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ use in children and adolescents. Do not give ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ to a child or adolescent. There is no experience with its use in children or adolescents under 18 years old. ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ use in the elderly ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ can be given to elderly patients over 65 years of age with a reduced dose. The effects of ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ in elderly patients are similar to those in other patients. The recommended maximum dose in elderly patients is 10 mg per day. 3. What if I am taking other medicines? Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Some medicines may interfere with ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ and affect how it works. These include: • Medicines used to treat nicotine dependence (e.g., bupropion) • Medicines used to treat reflux and ulcers, such as cimetidine, omeprazole, esomeprazole and lansoprazole • Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), known to prolong bleeding (e.g., aspirin and other NSAIDs) • Medicines used to prevent blood clots such as ticlopidine and warfarin • Anti-fungal medicines (e.g., fluconazole) • Anti-malaria medicines (e.g., mefloquine) • Medicines used to treat migraines (e.g., sumatriptan) • Medicines used to relieve pain (e.g., tramadol) • Medicines affecting chemicals in the brain • Some heart medicines such as. flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol • Amino-acids (e.g., tryptophan) ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ 3 • Medicines used to treat mood swings and some types of depression (e.g., lithium) • • Antipsychotics, a class of medicines use to treat certain mental and emotional disorders such as risperidone, thioridazine, haloperidol Tricyclic anti-depressants such as imipramine and desipramine St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), an herbal remedy • • Any other medicines for depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder or pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder • • These medicines may be affected by ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ, or may affect how well it works. You may need to use different amounts of your medicines, or take different medicines. Your doctor will advise you. Some combinations of medicines may increase the risk of serious side effects and are potentially life threatening. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure about what medicines, vitamins or supplements you are taking and if these affect ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ. 4. How do I use ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ? How much to take • • Your doctor will decide what dose you will receive. The standard dose for this medicine is 10 mg per day. This may be increased by your doctor to 20 mg per day. The recommended maximum dose in elderly patients is 10 mg per day. It is recommended that patients with liver disease receive an initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks. Your doctor may increase the dose to 10 mg daily. Your doctor may have prescribed a different dose. Follow the instructions provided and use ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ until your doctor tells you to stop. • • • • When to take ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ • ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ should be taken as a single dose either in the morning or in the evening. Take ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ with or without food. • How to take ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ • Swallow the tablets whole with a full glass of water • Do not chew them How long to take ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ Continue to take ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ even if it takes some time before you feel any improvement in your condition. As with other medicines for the treatment of these conditions it may take a few weeks before you feel any improvement. Individuals will vary greatly in their response to ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ. Your doctor will check your progress at regular intervals. The duration of treatment may vary for each individual, but is usually at least 6 months. In some cases the doctor may decide that longer treatment is necessary. Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you, even if you begin to feel better. The underlying illness may persist for a long time and if you stop your treatment too soon, your symptoms may return. Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly. If ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ is stopped suddenly you may experience mild, but usually temporary, symptoms such as dizziness, pins and needles, electric shock sensations, sleep disturbances (vivid dreams, inability to sleep), feeling anxious or agitated, headaches, feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, sweating, tremor (shaking), feeling confused, feeling emotional or irritable, diarrhoea, visual disturbances, or fast or irregular heartbeats. When you have completed your course of treatment, the dose of ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ is gradually reduced over a couple of weeks rather than stopped abruptly. Your doctor will tell you how to reduce the dosage so that you do not get these unwanted effects. If you forget to use ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ should be used regularly at the same time each day. If you miss your dose at the usual time, and remember in less than 12 hours, take it straight away, and then go back to taking it as you would normally. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose you missed. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist. If you have trouble remembering when to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for hints. If you use too much ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ If you think that you have used too much ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ, you may need urgent medical attention. Symptoms of an overdose may include dizziness, low blood pressure, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, agitation, tremor (shaking) and rarely convulsions and coma. ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ 4 You should immediately: • phone the Poisons Information Centre • • (by calling 13 11 26), or contact your doctor, or go to the Emergency Department at your nearest hospital. You should do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. 5. What should I know while using ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ? Things you should do If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ. Tell any other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who treat you that you are taking this medicine. If you become pregnant while taking ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ, tell your doctor immediately. Persons taking ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ may be more likely to think about killing themselves or actually trying to do so, especially when ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ is first started, or the dose is changed. Tell your doctor immediately if you have thoughts about killing yourself or if you are close to or care for someone using ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ who talks about or shows signs of killing him or herself. All mentions of suicide or violence must be taken seriously. Occasionally, the symptoms of depression may include thoughts of suicide or self-harm. It is possible that these symptoms continue or get worse until the full antidepressant effect of the medicine becomes apparent. This is more likely to occur if you are a young adult, i.e. 18 to 24 years of age, and you have not used antidepressant medicines before. Patients and care givers should pay attention for any of the following warning signs of suicide-related behaviour while taking ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ. Tell your doctor immediately, or even go to the nearest hospital for treatment: • • • • thoughts or talk of death or suicide thoughts or talk of self-harm or harm to others any recent attempts of self-harm increase in aggressive behaviour, irritability, or agitation These symptoms can occur during the first weeks of treatment. Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you suddenly experience an episode of mania. Some patients with bipolar disorder (manic depression) may enter into a manic phase. This is characterised by profuse and rapidly changing ideas, exaggerated gaiety, and excessive physical activity. Sometimes you may be unaware of the above-mentioned symptoms and therefore you may find it helpful to ask a friend or relative to help you to observe the possible signs of change in your behaviour. Call your doctor straight away if you: • difficulties urinating • seizures (fits) • yellowing of the skin and the white in the eyes are signs of liver function impairment/hepatitis • become pregnant while taking ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ • have thoughts about killing yourself or if you are close to or care for someone using ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ who talks about or shows signs of killing him or herself experience symptoms such as restlessness or difficulty in sitting or standing still suddenly experience an episode of mania. • • Remind any doctor, dentist or pharmacist you visit that you are using ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ. Things you should not do • Do not stop using this medicine suddenly, or lower the dosage without checking with your doctor. • Do not give the tablets to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you. • Do not take ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to. • Do not let yourself run out of medicine over the weekend or on holidays. At the beginning of treatment, some patients may experience increased anxiety which will disappear during continued treatment. Suddenly stopping ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ may cause unwanted discontinuation symptoms such as dizziness, sensory disturbances, sleep disturbances, agitation or anxiety tremor, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhoea, palpitations, emotional instability, irritability, visual disturbances, and nausea. Your doctor will tell you when and how ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ should be discontinued. Your doctor will gradually reduce the amount you are using, usually over a period of one to two weeks, before stopping completely. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as restlessness or difficulty in sitting or standing still. Driving or using machines Be careful before you drive or use any machines or tools until you know how ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ affects you. ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ 5 ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ may cause visual disturbance (such as blurred vision), nausea, fatigue, and dizziness in some people, especially early in the treatment. If you have any of these symptoms, do not drive, operate machinery, or do anything else that could be dangerous. Drinking alcohol Tell your doctor if you drink alcohol. It is not advisable to drink alcohol while you are being treated for depression. Looking after your medicine • Keep ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ tablets in the blister • pack until it is time to take them.

Treatment of social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION Adults Escitalopram is administered as a single oral dose and may be taken with or without food. Major depression Usually 2 - 4 weeks are necessary for antidepressant response, The recommended dose is 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet) once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg (one 20 mg tablet) daily, although the onset of therapeutic effect may be seen earlier. The treatment of a single episode of depression requires treatment over the acute and the medium term. After the symptoms resolve during acute treatment, a period of consolidation of the response is required. Therefore, treatment of a depressive episode should be continued for a minimum of 6 months. Social anxiety disorder The recommended dose is 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet) once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg (one 20 mg tablet) daily. Social anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course and long-term treatment is therefore warranted to consolidate response and prevent relapse. Generalised anxiety disorder The recommended dose is 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet) once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg (one 20 mg tablet) daily. Generalised anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course and long-term treatment is therefore warranted to consolidate response and prevent relapse. Obsessive-compulsive disorder The recommended starting dose is 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet) once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 20 mg (one 20 mg tablet) daily. Long-term treatment has been studied for a maximum of 40 weeks. Patients responding to a 16-week open-label treatment phase were randomised to a 24-week placebo-controlled relapse prevention phase, receiving 10 or 20 mg escitalopram daily. As OCD is a chronic disease, patients should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that they are symptom free. This period may be several months or even longer. Elderly patients (> 65 years of age) A longer half-life and a decreased clearance have been demonstrated in the elderly. 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet) is the recommended maximum maintenance dose in the elderly (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties and section 4.4 special warning and precautions for use). Children and adolescents (< 18 years of age) Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population. Escitalopram should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age (see section 4.4 special warning and precautions for use). Reduced hepatic function An initial dose of 5 mg (half a 10 mg tablet) daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet) (see section 4.4 special warning and precautions for use). Reduced renal function Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. No information is available on the treatment of patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) (see section 4.4 special warning and precautions for use). Poor metabolisers of CYP2C19 For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg (half a 10 mg tablet) daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet) (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties and section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). Discontinuation Significant numbers of discontinuation symptoms may occur with abrupt discontinuation of escitalopram. To minimise discontinuation reactions, tapered discontinuation over a period of at least one to two weeks is recommended. If unacceptable discontinuation symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the dose may be decreased but at a more gradual rate. 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to citalopram, escitalopram and any excipients in ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ (see section 6.1 List of excipients). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors - Escitalopram should not be used in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or the reversible MAOI (RIMA), moclobemide, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI, and at least one day after discontinuing treatment with the reversible MAOI (RIMA), moclobemide. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping escitalopram before starting a MAOI or RIMA. Cases of serious reactions, such as potentially life- threatening serotonin syndrome (characterised by neuromuscular excitation, altered mental status and autonomic dysfunction) have been reported in patients receiving an SSRI in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) or the reversible MAOI (RIMA), moclobemide, and in patients who have recently discontinued an SSRI and have been started on a MAOI (see section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). Pimozide - Concomitant use in patients taking pimozide is contraindicated (see section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE Identified precautions Clinical worsening and suicide risk The risk of suicide attempt is inherent in depression and may persist until significant remission occurs. This risk must be considered in all depressed patients. Patients with depression may experience worsening of their depressive symptoms and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behaviours (suicidality) whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. As improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored for clinical worsening and suicidality, especially at the beginning of a course of treatment, or at the time of dose changes, either increases or decreases. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse or whose emergent suicidality is severe, abrupt in onset, or was not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be alerted about the need to monitor for any worsening of their condition and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation/behaviour or thoughts of harming themselves and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms are present. Patients with comorbid depression associated with other psychiatric disorders being treated with antidepressants should be similarly observed for clinical worsening and suicidality. Patients with a history of suicide-related events, or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal ideation prior to commencement of treatment, are at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. Pooled analyses of 24 short-term (4 to 16-week), placebo-controlled trials of nine antidepressant medicines (SSRIs and others) in 4,400 children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (16 trials), obsessive-compulsive disorder (4 trials), or other psychiatric disorders (4 trials) have revealed a greater risk of adverse events representing suicidal behaviour or thinking (suicidality) during the first few months of treatment in those receiving antidepressants. The average risk of such events in patients treated with an antidepressant was 4%, compared with 2% of patients given placebo. There was considerable variation in risk among the antidepressants, but there was a tendency towards an increase for almost all antidepressants studied. The risk of suicidality was most consistently observed in the major depressive disorder trials, but there were signals of risk arising from trials in other psychiatric indications (obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder) as well. No suicides occurred in these trials. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk in children and adolescent patients extends to use beyond several months. The nine antidepressant medicines in the pooled analyses included five SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) and four non-SSRIs (bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, venlafaxine). Pooled analyses of short-term studies of antidepressant medications have also shown an increased risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour, known as suicidality, in young adults aged 18 to 24 years during initial treatment (generally the first one to two months). Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond the age of 24 years, and there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 years and older. Symptoms of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility (aggressiveness), impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adults, adolescents and children being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either worsening of depression and/or emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may be precursors of emerging suicidality. Families and caregivers of children and adolescents being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or for any other condition (psychiatric or non psychiatric) should be informed about the need to monitor these patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behaviour, and other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms to health care providers immediately. It is particularly important that monitoring be undertaken during the initial few months of antidepressant treatment or at times of dose increase or decrease. Prescriptions for escitalopram should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Akathisia/psychomotor restlessness The use of SSRIs/SNRIs has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a subjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability to sit or stand still. This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. In patients who develop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental. Haemorrhage Bleeding abnormalities of the skin and mucous membranes have been reported with the use of SSRIs (including purpura, ecchymoses, haematoma, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding). SSRIs/SNRIs may increase the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (see Sections 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation,"}

Haemorrhage Bleeding abnormalities of the skin and mucous membranes have been reported with the use of SSRIs (including purpura, ecchymoses, haematoma, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding). SSRIs/SNRIs may increase the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (see Sections 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation, 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Escitalopram should therefore be used with caution in patients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants, medicinal products known to affect platelet function (e.g. atypical antipsychotics and phenothiazines, most tricyclic antidepressants, acetylsalicylic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs), ticlopidine and dipyridamole) as well as in patients with a past history of abnormal bleeding or those with predisposing conditions. Pharmacological gastroprotection should be considered for high risk patients. Serotonin syndrome Caution is advisable if escitalopram is used concomitantly with medicinal products with serotonergic effects such as triptans (including sumatriptan), opioids (including tramadol), and tryptophan. Hyponatraemia Probably due to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), hyponatraemia has been reported as a rare adverse reaction with the use of SSRIs. Caution should be exercised in patients at risk, such as the elderly, or patients with cirrhosis, or if used in combination with other medications which may cause hyponatraemia. Seizures The drug should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures. SSRIs should be avoided in patients with unstable epilepsy and patients with controlled epilepsy should be carefully monitored. SSRIs should be discontinued if there is an increase in seizure frequency (see section 5.3 Preclinical safety data). Diabetes In patients with diabetes, treatment with an SSRI may alter glycaemic control, possibly due to improvement of depressive symptoms. Insulin and/or oral hypoglycaemic dosage may need to be adjusted. Mania A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone can increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk of bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder and depression. SSRIs should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania/hypomania. SSRIs should be discontinued in any patient entering a manic phase. Angle-closure Glaucoma Antidepressants including ESCITALOPRAM SANDOZ may have an effect on pupil size resulting in mydriasis. This mydriatic effect has the potential to narrow the eye angle resulting in increased intraocular pressure and angle-closure glaucoma, especially in pre-disposed patients. Escitalopram should therefore be used with caution in patients with raised intraocular pressure and in those at risk of angle-closure glaucoma. ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) There is limited published clinical experience of concurrent administration of SSRIs and ECT, therefore caution is advised. Discontinuation Discontinuation symptoms when stopping treatment are common, particularly if discontinuation is abrupt. The risk of discontinuation symptoms may be dependent on several factors including the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. Dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia and electric shock sensations), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhoea, palpitations, emotional instability, irritability, and visual disturbances are the most commonly reported reactions. Generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, in some patients they may be severe in intensity. They usually occur within the first few days of discontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have inadvertently missed a dose. Generally these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 weeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2 - 3 months or more). It is therefore advised that escitalopram should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of several weeks or months, according to the patient’s needs (see section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Cardiac disease Escitalopram has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Like other SSRIs, escitalopram causes a small decrease in heart rate. Consequently, caution should be observed when escitalopram is initiated in patients with pre-existing slow heart rate. Use in hepatic impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment, clearance of escitalopram was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased. The dose of escitalopram in hepatically impaired patients should therefore be reduced (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties and section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Use in renal impairment Escitalopram is extensively metabolised and excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. At present no information is available for the treatment of patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) and escitalopram should be used with caution in such patients (see section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Use in the elderly (> 65 years) Escitalopram AUC and half-life were increased in subjects ≥ 65 years of age compared to younger subjects in a single-dose and a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study. The dose of escitalopram in elderly patients should therefore be reduced (see section 4.2 Dose and method of administration) Paediatric use (children and adolescents < 18 years) The efficacy and safety of escitalopram has not been established in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age. Consequently, escitalopram should not be used in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age. Effects on laboratory tests See section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects) 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS MAOIs - Co-administration with MAO inhibitors may cause serotonin syndrome (see section 4.3 Contraindications). Reversible, non-selective MAO-inhibitor (linezolid) The antibiotic linezolid is a reversible non-selective MAO-inhibitor and should not be given to patients treated with escitalopram. If the combination proves necessary, it should be given with minimum dosages and under close clinical monitoring (see section 4.3 Contraindications). Irreversible, selective MAO-B inhibitor (selegiline) In combination with selegiline (irreversible MAO-B inhibitor), caution is required due to the risk of developing serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome Development of serotonin syndrome may occur in association with treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, particularly when given in combination with MAOIs or other serotonergic agents. Symptoms and signs of serotonin syndrome include rapid onset of neuromuscular excitation (hyperreflexia, incoordination, myoclonus, tremor), altered mental status (confusion, agitation, hypomania) and autonomic dysfunction (diaphoresis, diarrhoea, fever, shivering and rapidly fluctuating vital signs). Treatment with escitalopram should be discontinued if such events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment initiated. Pimozide Co-administration of a single dose of pimozide 2 mg to subjects treated with racemic citalopram 40 mg/day for 11 days caused an increase in AUC and Cmax of pimozide, although not consistently throughout the study. The co-administration of pimozide and citalopram resulted in a mean increase in the QTc interval of approximately 10 msec. Due to the interaction with citalopram noted at a low dose of pimozide, concomitant administration of escitalopram and pimozide is contraindicated (see section 4.3 Contraindications). Serotonergic drugs Co-administration with serotonergic drugs e.g. opioids (including tramadol), triptans (including sumatriptan) may lead to an enhancement of serotonergic effects. Similarly, Hypericum perforatum (St John’s Wort) should be avoided as adverse interactions have been reported with a range of drugs including antidepressants. Lithium and tryptophan There have been reports of enhanced effects when SSRIs have been given with lithium or tryptophan and therefore concomitant use of SSRIs with these drugs should be undertaken with caution. Medicines affecting the central nervous system Given the primary CNS effects of escitalopram, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Medicines lowering the seizure threshold SSRIs can lower the seizure threshold. Caution is advised when concomitantly using other medicinal products capable of lowering the seizure threshold (e.g. antidepressants (tricyclics, SSRIs), neuroleptics (phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, butyrophenones), mefloquine, bupropion and tramadol). Hepatic enzymes Escitalopram has a low potential for clinically significant drug interactions. In vitro studies have shown that the biotransformation of escitalopram to its demethylated metabolites depends on three parallel pathways (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19, 3A4 and 2D6). Escitalopram is a very weak inhibitor of isoenzyme CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2E1, and 3A4, and a weak inhibitor of 2D6. Effects of other drugs on escitalopram in vivo The pharmacokinetics of escitalopram was not changed by co-administration with ritonavir (CYP3A4 inhibitor). Furthermore, co-administration with ketoconazole (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) did not change the pharmacokinetics of racemic citalopram. Co-administration of escitalopram with omeprazole (a CYP2C19 inhibitor) resulted in a moderate (approximately 50%) increase in plasma concentrations of escitalopram and a small but statistically significant increase (31%) in the terminal half-life of escitalopram (see also Poor metabolisers of CYP2C19 under section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Co-administration of escitalopram with cimetidine (moderately potent general enzyme inhibitor) resulted in a moderate (approximately 70%) increase in the plasma concentrations of escitalopram. Thus, caution should be exercised at the upper end of the dose range of escitalopram when used concomitantly with CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole, esomeprazole, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, lansoprazole, fluconazole, and ticlopidine) or cimetidine. A reduction in the dose of escitalopram may be necessary based on clinical judgement (see also Poor metabolisers of CYP2C19 under section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Effects of escitalopram on other drugs in vivo Escitalopram is an inhibitor of the enzyme CYP2D6. Caution is recommended when escitalopram is co-administered with medicinal products that are mainly metabolised by this enzyme, and that have a narrow therapeutic index, e.g. flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol (when used in cardiac failure), or some CNS acting medicinal products that are mainly metabolised by CYP2D6, e.g. antidepressants such as desipramine, clomipramine and nortriptyline or antipsychotics like risperidone, thioridazine and haloperidol. Dosage adjustment may be warranted. Co-administration with desipramine (a CYP2D6 substrate) resulted in a twofold increase in plasma levels of desipramine. Therefore, caution is advised when escitalopram and desipramine are co- administered. A similar increase in plasma levels of desipramine, after administration of imipramine, was seen when given together with racemic citalopram."}

A similar increase in plasma levels of desipramine, after administration of imipramine, was seen when given together with racemic citalopram. Co-administration with metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate) resulted in a twofold increase in the plasma levels of metoprolol. However, the combination had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure and heart rate. The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir (CYP3A4 inhibitor) was not changed by co-administration with escitalopram. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic interaction studies with racemic citalopram have demonstrated no clinically important interactions with carbamazepine (CYP3A4 substrate), triazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 substrate), levomepromazine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), lithium and digoxin. Haemorrhage Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in haemostasis. There is an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of abnormal bleeding. Concurrent use of an NSAID, aspirin or warfarin potentiates this risk. Thus, patients should be cautioned about using such medicines concurrently with escitalopram. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy should receive careful coagulation monitoring when escitalopram is started or stopped (see section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Alcohol The combination of SSRIs and alcohol is not advisable. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on fertility No fertility studies were performed with escitalopram. However, other nonclinical studies suggest that the effects of escitalopram can be directly predicted from those of the citalopram racemate. In rats, female fertility was unaffected by oral treatment with citalopram doses which achieved plasma drug concentrations slightly in excess of those expected in humans, but effects on male rat fertility have not been tested with adequate oral doses. Animal data have shown that some SSRIs induce a reduction of fertility index and pregnancy index, reduction in number in implantation and abnormal sperm. No animal data related to this aspect are available for escitalopram. Animal data have shown that some SSRIs may affect sperm quality. Use in pregnancy: Category C. Limited clinical data are available regarding exposure to escitalopram during pregnancy. Newborns should be observed if maternal use of escitalopram continues into the later stages of pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. If escitalopram is used until or shortly before birth, discontinuation effects in the newborn are possible. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided during pregnancy (see section 4.2 Dose and method of administration, 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and 4.8 Adverse effects (undesirable effects)). Newborns exposed to escitalopram, other SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), or SNRIs (Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors), late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalisation, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnoea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycaemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, lethargy, constant crying, somnolence and difficulty sleeping. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. In the majority of cases the complications begin immediately or soon (< 24 hours) after delivery. Epidemiological studies have shown that the use of SSRI’s (including escitalopram) in pregnancy, particularly use in late pregnancy, was associated with an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). The risk of PPHN among infants born to women who used SSRIs late in pregnancy was estimated to be 4 to 5 times higher than the rate of 1 to 2 per 1000 pregnancies observed in the general population. Oral treatment of rats with escitalopram during organogenesis at maternotoxic doses led to increased post-implantation loss and reduced foetal weight at systemic exposure levels (based on AUC) ca. 11- fold that anticipated clinically, with no effects seen at 6-fold. No teratogenicity was evident in this study at relative systemic exposure levels of ca. 15 (based on AUC). There were no peri/postnatal effects of escitalopram following oral dosing of pregnant rats (conception through to weaning) at systemic exposure levels (based on AUC) ca. 2-fold that anticipated clinically. However, the number of stillbirths was increased and the size, weight and postnatal survival of offspring were decreased at a relative systemic exposure level ca. 5. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and only after careful consideration of the risk/benefit. Observational data indicate an increased risk (less than 2-fold) of postpartum haemorrhage following SSRI/SNRI exposure within the month prior to birth (see Sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, 4.8 Adverse effects (undesirable effects)). Use in lactation It is expected that escitalopram, like citalopram, will be excreted into human breast milk. Studies in nursing mothers have shown that the mean combined dose of citalopram and demethylcitalopram transmitted to infants via breast milk (expressed as a percentage of the weight-adjusted maternal dose) is 4.4 – 5.1% (below the notional 10% level of concern). Plasma concentrations of these drugs in infants were very low or absent and there were no adverse effects. Whilst the citalopram data support the safety of use of escitalopram in breast-feeding women, the decision to breast-feed should always be made as an individual risk/benefit analysis. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES Escitalopram does not impair intellectual function and psychomotor performance. However, adverse effects of escitalopram oxalate include visual disturbances (such as blurred vision) and dizziness which could affect the ability to drive or use machines (see Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)). As with other psychoactive drugs, patients should be cautioned about their ability to drive a car and operate machinery. 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Adverse reactions observed with escitalopram are in general mild and transient. They are most frequent during the first one or two weeks of treatment and usually decrease in intensity and frequency with continued treatment and generally do not lead to a cessation of therapy. Data from short-term placebo-controlled studies are presented below. The safety data from the long-term studies showed a similar profile. Table 1: Treatment Emergent Adverse Events with an Incidence of ≥ 1% in placebo-controlled trials Figures marked with * in the table below indicate adverse reactions where the incidence with escitalopram is statistically significantly different from placebo (p<0.05).

These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with escitalopram treatment. ECG Changes Cases of QT prolongation have been reported during the post-marketing period with both citalopram and escitalopram. Citalopram can cause dose-dependent QT interval prolongation. In an ECG study, the observed change from baseline QTC (Fridericia correction) was 7.5 msec at the 20mg/day dose and 16.7 msec at the 60mg/day dose of citalopram. The effect of escitalopram on the QT interval was similarly studied at doses of 10mg/day and 30mg/day. The change from baseline QTc (Fridericia correction) was 4.3 msec at the 10mg/day dose and 10.7 msec with the above recommended dose of 30mg/day. The QTc interval prolongation observed with 60mg citalopram exceeded that observed with 30mg escitalopram. It is probable that the R-enantiomer and its metabolites in racemic citalopram contribute to these effects. Mydriasis and angle-closure glaucoma Cases of mydriasis and angle-closure glaucoma have been reported in the post-marketing period (see section 4.4 Special warning and precautions for use) Weight Changes Patients treated with escitalopram in controlled trials did not differ from placebo-treated patients with regard to clinically important change in body weight. Laboratory Changes In clinical studies, there were no signals of clinically important changes in either various serum chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis parameters associated with escitalopram treatment compared to placebo or in the incidence of patients meeting the criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. For abnormal laboratory changes registered as either uncommon events or serious adverse events from ongoing trials and observed during (but not necessarily caused by) treatment with escitalopram, please see Other Events Observed during the Premarketing Evaluation of escitalopram under section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects).

In addition, although no causal relationship to racemic citalopram treatment has been found, the following adverse events have been reported to be temporally associated with racemic citalopram treatment subsequent to the marketing of racemic citalopram and were not observed during the premarketing evaluation of escitalopram or citalopram: acute renal failure, akathisia, anaphylaxis, choreoathetosis, delirium, dyskinesia, epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, haemolytic anaemia, hepatic necrosis, myoclonus, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, nystagmus, pancreatitis, priapism, prolactinaemia, prothrombin decreased, QT prolonged, rhabdomyolysis, spontaneous abortion, thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, Torsades de pointes, ventricular arrhythmia, and withdrawal syndrome. Class effect Epidemiological studies, mainly conducted in patients 50 years of age and older, show an increased risk of bone fractures in patients receiving SSRIs and TCAs. The mechanism leading to this risk is unknown. Postpartum haemorrhage has been reported for the therapeutic class of SSRIs/SNRIs (see Sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation). Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment Discontinuation of SSRIs/SNRIs (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to discontinuation symptoms. Dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia and electric shock sensations), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), agitation or anxiety, nausea and/or vomiting, tremor, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhoea, palpitations, emotional instability, irritability, and visual disturbances are the most commonly reported reactions. Generally these events are mild to moderate and are self-limiting, however, in some patients they may be severe and/or prolonged. It is therefore advised that when escitalopram treatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see section 4.2 Dose and method of administration and 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Reporting suspected adverse effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions at www.tga.gov.au/reporting- problems. 4.9 OVERDOSE In general, the main therapy for all overdoses is supportive and symptomatic care. Toxicity Clinical data on escitalopram overdose are limited and many cases involve concomitant overdoses of other drugs. In the majority of cases mild or no symptoms have been reported.

Toxicity Clinical data on escitalopram overdose are limited and many cases involve concomitant overdoses of other drugs. In the majority of cases mild or no symptoms have been reported. Fatal cases of escitalopram overdose have rarely been reported with escitalopram alone; the majority of cases have involved overdose with concomitant medications. Doses between 400 and 800 mg of escitalopram alone have been taken without any severe symptoms. Symptoms Symptoms seen in reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmia and ECG changes (including QT prolongation), and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions. Treatment There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. The use of activated charcoal should be considered. Activated charcoal may reduce absorption of the drug if given within one or two hours after ingestion. In patients who are not fully conscious or have impaired gag reflex, consideration should be given to administering activated charcoal via a nasogastric tube, once the airway is protected. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures.

The antidepressant action of escitalopram is presumably linked to the potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibitory effect on the reuptake of 5- HT from the synaptic cleft. Escitalopram is a highly selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI). On the basis of in vitro studies, escitalopram had no, or minimal effect on noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake. In contrast to many tricyclic antidepressants and some of the SSRIs, escitalopram has no or very low affinity for a series of receptors including 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, DA D1 and DA D2 receptors, α1-, α2-, β- adrenoceptors, histamine H1, muscarine cholinergic, benzodiazepine, and opioid receptors. A series of functional in vitro tests in isolated organs as well as functional in vivo tests have confirmed the lack of receptor affinity. Escitalopram has high affinity for the primary binding site and an allosteric modulating effect on the serotonin transporter. Allosteric modulation of the serotonin transporter enhances binding of escitalopram to the primary binding site, resulting in more complete serotonin reuptake inhibition. Escitalopram is the S-enantiomer of the racemate (citalopram) and is the enantiomer to which the therapeutic activity is attributed. Pharmacological studies have shown that the R-enantiomer is not inert but counteracts the serotonin-enhancing properties of the S-enantiomer in citalopram. In healthy volunteers and in patients escitalopram did not cause clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECGs, or laboratory parameters. S-demethylcitalopram, the main plasma metabolite, attains about 30% of parent compound levels after oral dosing and is about 5-fold less potent at inhibiting 5- HT reuptake than escitalopram in vitro. It is therefore unlikely to contribute significantly to the overall antidepressant effect. Clinical trials Escitalopram should not be used for the treatment of major depression, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years since the safety and efficacy in this population have not been established. Major Depression Escitalopram should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. Two fixed-dose studies and one flexible-dose study have shown escitalopram in the dose range 10 – 20 mg/day to be more efficacious than placebo in the treatment of depression. All three studies were randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies. Two of the studies included an active reference (citalopram). All three studies consisted of a 1-week single-blind placebo lead-in period followed by an 8-week double-blind treatment period. Patients were required to have depression with a minimum score of 22 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at both the screening and baseline visits. The MADRS consists of 10 items that measure core symptoms of depression, such as sadness, tension, pessimism and suicidal thoughts. Each item is rated on a scale of 0 (no abnormality) to 6 (severe). The populations studied were therefore defined as suffering from moderate to severe depression (mean MADRS score 29). A total of 591 patients received escitalopram in these studies. All three studies showed escitalopram to be statistically significantly superior to placebo on the ITT LOCF analysis of the mean change from baseline in the MADRS total score (p≤0.01). The magnitude of the difference between escitalopram and placebo in the MADRS change score ranged from 2.7 to 4.6 (mean of these values: 3.6). The magnitude of the difference for citalopram ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 (mean of these values: 2.0). The magnitude of the difference is larger with escitalopram than with citalopram. Escitalopram demonstrated a significant early difference compared to placebo from week 2 onwards on the MADRS (week 1 in observed cases analysis). Likewise, the Clinical Global Impression– Improvement items (CGI-I) differed significantly from placebo from week 1 onwards. These early differences were not seen with racemic citalopram. In the study with two parallel escitalopram dose groups, analysis of subgroups of patients showed a trend towards greater improvement in patients with severe major depressive disorder (HAM-D > 25) receiving 20 mg/day as compared to 10 mg/day. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) consists of 17 to 24 items reflecting core symptoms of depression. Each item is scored on a 3, 4, or 5 point scale with 0 reflecting no symptoms and higher scores reflecting increasing symptom severity. In a fourth flexible-dose study with a similar design, the primary analysis did not distinguish a significant drug/placebo difference for either escitalopram or citalopram over 8 weeks on the MADRS change score in the LOCF dataset. However, on the basis of the OC analysis, both escitalopram and citalopram were significantly better than placebo (p≤0.05; difference between escitalopram and placebo: 2.9). Escitalopram demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of anxiety symptoms associated with depression. In the three positive double-blind placebo-controlled studies escitalopram was shown to be effective compared to placebo on the MADRS anxiety items; inner tension and sleep disturbances. Furthermore, in the one study where the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and the anxiety factor of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D scale) were used, results have shown that escitalopram was significantly better than placebo. In a relapse prevention trial, 274 patients meeting (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder, who had responded during an initial 8-week open-label treatment phase with escitalopram 10 or 20 mg/day, were randomised to continuation of escitalopram at the same dose, or to placebo, for up to 36 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open-label phase was defined as a decrease of the MADRS total score to ≤ 12. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of the MADRS total score to ≥ 22, or discontinuation due to insufficient clinical response. Patients receiving continued escitalopram experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the subsequent 36 weeks compared to those receiving placebo (26% vs. 40%; hazard ratio=0.56, p=0.013). Further evidence of long-term efficacy is provided in a 6-month study which compared escitalopram 10 mg/day to citalopram 20 mg/day over a 6-month treatment period. Analysis of the primary endpoint (the development of the MADRS total scores over 24 weeks) demonstrated escitalopram to be at least as efficacious as citalopram in the long-term treatment of depression. Secondary analyses showed that, while both treatments resulted in numerical improvements in ratings in the MADRS, HAM-A and the CGI, escitalopram was statistically superior to citalopram in several analyses, both during and at the end of the study. Additional supportive evidence of the sustained efficacy of escitalopram treatment is demonstrated in an open-label 12-month study. The efficacy of escitalopram was maintained throughout the study, as measured by the MADRS total score and CGI-S score. Patients showed continued improvement, with total MADRS scores falling from 14.2 at baseline to 5.8 at last assessment, and CGI-scores falling from 2.7 at baseline to 1.6 at last assessment. A study in the elderly did not provide conclusive efficacy results for escitalopram, as the reference drug (fluoxetine) failed to differentiate from placebo. However, safety data from this study showed escitalopram to be well tolerated. Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Escitalopram should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. The efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder was demonstrated in three 8-week placebo-controlled flexible-dose studies (10 to 20 mg per day) and one 12-week fixed- dose, active-reference (paroxetine 20 mg/day), study (5, 10 and 20 mg per day). In the four studies, the mean HAM-A total scores at baseline ranged from 22.1 to 27.7 and the CGI-S scores were 4.2 or higher, indicating significant GAD symptomatology. In all three placebo-controlled, flexible-dose studies, escitalopram was significantly better than placebo at endpoint on the primary efficacy measure (mean change from baseline to endpoint in HAM-A total score), and the results were supported by secondary efficacy measures. In the fixed-dose study, over a 12-week period, escitalopram in doses of 10 and 20 mg/day was statistically significantly more effective than placebo on the primary measure of efficacy, with an effect size at least as high as that of the reference treatment paroxetine. The 5 mg dose of escitalopram was numerically, but not statistically significantly, superior to placebo. 10 mg escitalopram was statistically significantly superior to the reference treatment paroxetine (LOCF) based on the HAM-A and CGI-I.

The separation from placebo was first observed at week 1 and continued through to the end of the study (week 8). The treatment difference to placebo at week 8 was –2.3 in favour of escitalopram (p≤0.01). The results of the primary analysis (pooled data) were supported by secondary LOCF analyses (pooled data), where escitalopram was statistically significantly superior to placebo on the HAM-A psychic anxiety subscale score (p≤0.001), the HAM-A item 1 (anxious mood) score (p≤0.001), and the HAM- A item 2 (tension) score (p≤0.01). Escitalopram was also more effective than placebo on the CGI-S score (p≤0.01) and on the CGI-I score at week 8 (p≤0.001). The results on the HAD anxiety subscale, the HAM-A somatic subscale, the HAM-D anxiety scale, the Covi Anxiety Scale (OC), and the QoL (OC) also showed superior efficacy of escitalopram relative to placebo at week 8 (p≤0.05). The long-term efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of GAD is based on the results from the double-blind active comparator study, an open-label extension study and a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled relapse prevention study. The active comparator study demonstrated numerically superior efficacy of escitalopram over paroxetine both on the primary efficacy measure (mean change from baseline in HAM-A total score) and on the secondary efficacy measures (mean change from baseline in HAM-A psychic anxiety, CGI- S, QoL, HAM-A somatic anxiety, HAM-A item 1 (anxious mood), HAM-A item 2 (tension), HAM-D anxiety and Covi scores, and mean CGI-I score) at week 24. For all but one (QoL) of the efficacy measures, a further improvement was seen from week 8 to week 24. In the primary efficacy analysis, the extra improvement in mean HAM-A total score over the last 16 weeks of treatment was 2.3 points for escitalopram compared with 1.6 points for paroxetine. Further evidence of long-term efficacy is provided by an open-label extension study, which showed a beneficial effect of continued treatment with escitalopram. In this study, escitalopram treatment was associated with additional improvement beyond the response observed during the initial 8 weeks of treatment in the lead-in studies. The mean change in HAM-A total score from baseline (final visit of the lead-in study) to week 24 (LOCF) was -3.8, with greater improvement observed in patients who were switched from placebo in the lead-in study to escitalopram in the extension study (4.9 points versus 2.7 points for those previously treated with escitalopram). Similar positive results were seen in the analyses of secondary efficacy measures. Escitalopram 20 mg/day significantly reduced the risk of relapse in a 24- to 76-week randomised continuation study in 373 patients who had responded during the initial 12-week open-label treatment. Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) Escitalopram should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. The efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of SAD was demonstrated in three placebo-controlled clinical studies. A short-term, flexible-dose (10 to 20 mg/day) study, a long-term, fixed-dose (5, 10, and 20 mg/day), active-reference (paroxetine 20 mg/day) study, and a relapse prevention study. Approximately two-thirds of patients in the studies were markedly or severely ill (score of 5 or 6 on the CGI-S) and one-third were moderately ill (score of 4 or less on the CGI-S). The mean baseline LSAS total score ranged from 92 to 96 in the three studies. In the short-term, flexible-dose study, over a 12-week period, escitalopram was statistically significantly better than placebo on the primary, and almost all the secondary measures of efficacy (see Table 4). In the placebo-controlled, active-reference study, escitalopram was effective both in the short- and in the long-term (see Table 4), with an effect size at least as high as that of the reference treatment paroxetine (escitalopram 20 mg/day was significantly superior to the reference treatment paroxetine 20 mg/day from week 16 and onwards (OC)). Thus, continued treatment with escitalopram improves treatment response. At week 24 of the study, all three doses of escitalopram also produced significant improvements in the LSAS subscale scores for fear/anxiety and avoidance, the CGI-I score (except for the 10 mg dose of escitalopram), the CGI-S score, and the SDS subscale scores for work, social life, and family life.

The analyses showed a further increase both in the proportion of responders and in the proportion of remitters from week 12 to week 24, especially in the escitalopram 20 mg group. At week 24, a statistically significantly greater proportion of responders and remitters were seen in all three escitalopram dose groups (except for the proportion of responders in the 10 mg group) than in the placebo group (p≤0.01) (see Tables 5 and 6).

Furthermore, patients treated with escitalopram had fewer protocol-defined relapses than those treated with placebo. In addition, patients treated with escitalopram showed a further improvement in mean LSAS total score during the double-blind period, while patients treated with placebo showed deterioration. Escitalopram was also statistically significantly superior to placebo at week 24 on all the secondary efficacy measures in this study: the LSAS total score, the LSAS subscale scores for fear/anxiety and avoidance, the CGI-S score, and the SDS subscale scores for work, social life, and family life (p≤0.001). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Escitalopram should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. Efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of OCD was investigated in two clinical trials, a 24-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study (with efficacy assessments at week 12 and week 24) and a 16 + 24-week placebo-controlled relapse prevention study. Patients included in these studies were male and female outpatients aged 18 – 65 years with a diagnosis of OCD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV- TR) criteria and a pre-defined minimum score of 20 on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Patients had actual baseline Y-BOCS scores of approx. 27, indicating significant OCD symptomatology. A structured clinical interview, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), was used to assist in the diagnosis and to exclude relevant psychiatric comorbidities. In order to avoid the confounding variable of significant concomitant depression, patients with more than mild depressive symptoms, i.e. a score of 22 or more on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), were excluded. To ensure a relatively homogenous population with OCD, patients currently diagnosed with any other psychiatric disorders as per Axis I of DSM-IV-TR or any clinically significant unstable medical illness were also excluded. Results at week 12 of the 24-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study are shown in Tables 7 and 8. In the short-term (12 weeks), 20 mg/day escitalopram separated from placebo on the Y-BOCS total score.

Maintenance of efficacy and prevention of relapse were investigated in the relapse prevention study. This 24-week relapse prevention study was preceded by a 16-week open-label period with patients initially receiving escitalopram 10 mg/day. In case of lack of efficacy (as judged by the investigator), the dose could be increased to a maximum of 20 mg/day. If dose-limiting adverse effects occurred, it was permissible to decrease the dose to 10 mg/day. Thus the dose of escitalopram was flexible at 10 – 20 mg/day from week 2 to 12. Subsequently, the dose was fixed at the dose received at the end of week 12 until week 16 to allow stabilisation of the patient on this dose. Responders to treatment were defined as patients with a decrease in Y-BOCS total score from baseline by ≥ 25% at week 16, and remitters were defined as Y-BOCS ≤ 10. See Table 10 for responder and remitter rates at the end of the 16-week open-label phase. Table 10 Relapse prevention study (16 week open-label, flexible- dose phase) Responders (Reduction of Y- BOCS ≥ 25%) (APTS I, LOCF) (%) Remitters (Y-BOCS ≤ 10) (APTS I, LOCF) (%) ESC 74.4 34.0 ESC = escitalopram 10 & 20 mg Responders at the end of the above 16-week open-label treatment phase (escitalopram 10 mg: 30 responders; escitalopram 20 mg: 133 responders) entered the 24-week randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled relapse prevention phase. Both escitalopram 10 mg/day (p=0.014) and 20 mg/day (p<0.001) showed significantly fewer relapses. 5.2 PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES Absorption Data specific to escitalopram are unavailable. Absorption is expected to be almost complete and independent of food intake (mean Tmax is 4 hours after multiple dosing). While the absolute bioavailability of escitalopram has not been studied, it is unlikely to differ significantly from that of racemic citalopram (about 80%). Distribution The apparent volume of distribution (Vd,β/F) after oral administration is about 12 to 26 L/kg. The binding of escitalopram to human plasma proteins is independent of drug plasma levels and averages 55%. Metabolism Escitalopram is metabolised in the liver to the demethylated and didemethylated metabolites. Alternatively, the nitrogen may be oxidised to form the N-oxide metabolite. Both parent and metabolites are partly excreted as glucuronides. Unchanged escitalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. After multiple dosing the mean concentrations of the demethyl and didemethyl metabolites are usually 28 – 31% and < 5% of the escitalopram concentration, respectively. Biotransformation of escitalopram to the demethylated metabolite is mediated by a combination of CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Excretion The elimination half-life (t½β) after multiple dosing is about 30 hours and the oral plasma clearance (Cloral) is about 0.6 L/min. Escitalopram and major metabolites are, like racemic citalopram, assumed to be eliminated both by the hepatic (metabolic) and the renal routes with the major part of the dose excreted as metabolites in urine. Approximately 8.0% of escitalopram is eliminated unchanged in urine and 9.6% as the S- demethylcitalopram metabolite based on 20 mg escitalopram data. Hepatic clearance is mainly by the P450 enzyme system. The pharmacokinetics of escitalopram are linear over the clinical dosage range. Steady state plasma levels are achieved in about 1 week. Average steady state concentrations of 50 nmol/L (range 20 to 125 nmol/L) are achieved at a daily dose of 10 mg. Special Populations Reduced hepatic function In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Criteria A and B), the half-life of escitalopram was about twice as long and the exposure was about 60% higher than in subjects with normal liver function (see section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Reduced renal function While there is no specific data, the use of escitalopram in reduced renal function may be extrapolated from that of racemic citalopram. Escitalopram is expected to be eliminated more slowly in patients with mild to moderate reduction of renal function with no major impact on the escitalopram concentrations in serum. At present no information is available for the treatment of patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). Elderly patients (> 65 years) Escitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects > 65 years of age were compared to younger subjects in a single-dose and a multiple-dose study. Escitalopram AUC and half-life were increased by approximately 50% in elderly subjects, and Cmax was unchanged. 10 mg is the recommended dose for elderly patients. Gender In a multiple-dose study of escitalopram (10 mg/day for 3 weeks) in 18 male (9 elderly and 9 young) and 18 female (9 elderly and 9 young) subjects, there were no differences in AUC, Cmax and half-life between the male and female subjects. No adjustment of dosage on the basis of gender is needed. Polymorphism It has been observed that poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19 have twice as high a plasma concentration of escitalopram as extensive metabolisers. No significant change in exposure was observed in poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2D6 (see section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). 5.3 PRECLINICAL SAFETY DATA High doses of escitalopram, which resulted in plasma Cmax for escitalopram and metabolites at least 8- fold greater than anticipated clinically, have been associated with convulsions, ECG abnormalities and cardiovascular changes in experimental animals. Of the cardiovascular changes, cardiotoxicity (including congestive heart failure) was observed in comparative toxicological studies in rats following oral escitalopram or citalopram administration for 4 to 13 weeks and appears to correlate with peak plasma concentrations although its exact mechanism is not clear. Clinical experiences with citalopram, and the clinical trial experience with escitalopram, do not indicate that these findings have a clinical correlate. Genotoxicity No genotoxicity studies were performed with escitalopram. However, other nonclinical studies suggest that the effects of escitalopram can be directly predicted from those of the citalopram racemate. Carcinogenicity No carcinogenicity studies were performed with escitalopram. However, other nonclinical studies suggest that the effects of escitalopram can be directly predicted from those of the citalopram racemate. Citalopram did not show any carcinogenic activity in long-term oral studies using mice and rats at doses up to 240 and 80 mg/kg/day, respectively. In assays of genotoxic activity, citalopram showed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity. 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 LIST OF EXCIPIENTS Mannitol microcrystalline cellulose maize starch croscarmellose sodium magnesium stearate opadry 04F58804 White, ARTG PI No.: 11793 (contains hypromellose, macrogol 6000 and titanium dioxide). 6.2 INCOMPATIBILITIES Incompatibilities were either not assessed or not identified as part of the registration of this medicine. 6.3 SHELF LIFE In Australia, information on the shelf life can be found on the public summary of the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).

Ozempic 1 mg/dose One mL of solution contains 1.34 mg semaglutide. One pre-filled pen contains 4 mg semaglutide in 3 mL solution. Semaglutide is a human glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by recombinant DNA technology followed by protein purification. For the full list of excipients, see Section 6.1 List of Excipients. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 3. Ozempic solution for injection is provided in a pre-filled multidose disposable pen, which contains semaglutide in a 1.5 mL or 3 mL cartridge. It is a clear and colourless, or almost colourless, isotonic solution with pH = 7.4. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS Therapeutic Indications 4.1 Ozempic is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise: - - as monotherapy when metformin is not tolerated or contraindicated. in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Ozempic is indicated as an adjunct to standard of care therapy to reduce the risk of sustained decline of kidney function and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 1 of 34 type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties – Clinical trials). 4.2 Dose and Method of Administration Dosage Ozempic starting dose is 0.25 mg once weekly. After 4 weeks, the dose should be increased to 0.5 mg once weekly. After at least 4 weeks with a dose of 0.5 mg once weekly, the dose can be increased to 1 mg once weekly to further improve glycaemic control. Ozempic 0.25 mg is not a maintenance dose. When Ozempic is added to existing metformin and/or thiazolidinedione therapy, the current dose of metformin and/or thiazolidinedione can be continued unchanged. When Ozempic is added to existing therapy of a sulfonylurea or insulin, a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin should be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use). The use of Ozempic does not require blood glucose self-monitoring. Self-monitoring may be performed when Ozempic is used together with sulfonylurea or insulin in order to allow adjustment of the dose of these medications. Method of Administration Ozempic is to be administered once weekly, on the same day each week, at any time of the day, with or without meals. Ozempic is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, in the thigh or in the upper arm. The injection site can be changed without dose adjustment. Ozempic should not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. For further information on administration, see section 6 Pharmaceutical Particulars. The day of weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the time between two doses is at least 3 days (>72 hours). After selecting a new dosing day, once-weekly dosing should be continued. If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible and within 5 days after the missed dose. If more than 5 days have passed, the missed dose should be skipped, and the next dose should be administered on the regularly scheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their regular once weekly dosing schedule. Dosage Adjustment Elderly (≥65 years old) No dose adjustment is required based on age. Therapeutic experience in patients ≥75 years of age is limited (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). Gender No dose adjustment is required based on gender. Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 2 of 34 Race and Ethnicity No dose adjustment is required based on race and ethnicity. Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). Experience with the use of semaglutide in patients with severe hepatic impairment is limited. Caution should be exercised when treating these patients with semaglutide. Patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. Experience with the use of semaglutide in patients with end-stage kidney disease is limited. Children and adolescents Safety and efficacy of Ozempic in children and adolescents below 18 years have not been studied. Contraindications 4.3 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 List of Excipients. Special Warnings and Precautions for Use 4.4 Ozempic should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Ozempic is not a substitute for insulin. Aspiration in association with general anaesthesia or deep sedation Cases of pulmonary aspiration have been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 RAs undergoing general anaesthesia (GA) or deep sedation despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. Therefore, the increased risk of residual gastric content because of delayed gastric emptying should be considered prior to performing procedures with GA or deep sedation. Gastrointestinal Effects Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions. This should be considered when treating patients with impaired renal function as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, may cause dehydration which could cause a deterioration of renal function. Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis, has been observed with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, Ozempic should be discontinued; if confirmed, Ozempic should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 3 of 34 Hypoglycaemia Patients treated with Ozempic in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia can be lowered by reducing the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin when initiating treatment with Ozempic. Diabetic Retinopathy In patients with diabetic retinopathy treated with insulin and semaglutide, an increased risk of developing diabetic retinopathy complications has been observed (see section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects)). Caution should be exercised when using semaglutide in patients with diabetic retinopathy treated with insulin. Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Long-term glycaemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for worsening and treated according to clinical guidelines. Acute kidney injury There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require haemodialysis, in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Some of these events have been reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or dehydration. Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses of Ozempic in patients reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions. Populations not studied There is no therapeutic experience in patients with congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV and therefore use of semgalutide is not recommended in these patients. There is limited experience in patients with a history of severe gastroparesis. Use with caution in these patients. Use in hepatic impairment Experience with the use of semaglutide in patients with severe hepatic impairment is limited. Caution should be exercised when treating these patients with semaglutide. Use in renal impairment No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. Experience with the use of semaglutide in patients with end-stage kidney disease is limited. Use in elderly See section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties. Paediatric Use The safety and efficacy of semaglutide in children and adolescents aged below 18 years has not been studied. Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 4 of 34 Effects on laboratory tests No data available. Interactions with Other Medicines and Other Forms of Interactions 4.5 In vitro studies have shown very low potential for semaglutide to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes, and to inhibit drug transporters. The delay of gastric emptying with semaglutide may influence the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products, therefore semaglutide should be used with caution in patients receiving oral medicinal products that require rapid gastrointestinal absorption. The potential effect of semaglutide on the absorption of co-administered oral medications was studied in trials at semaglutide 1 mg steady state exposure. No clinically relevant drug-drug interaction with semaglutide (Figure 1) was observed based on the evaluated medications. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required when co- administered with semaglutide. Relative exposure in terms of AUC and Cmax for each medication when given with semaglutide compared to without semaglutide. Metformin and oral contraceptive drug (ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel) were assessed at steady state. Warfarin (S-warfarin/R-warfarin), digoxin and atorvastatin were assessed after a single dose. Abbreviations: AUC: area under the curve. Cmax: maximum concentration. CI: confidence interval. Figure 1: Impact of semaglutide on the exposure of co-administered oral medications Oral Contraceptives Semaglutide is not anticipated to decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives as semaglutide did not change the overall exposure of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel to a clinically relevant degree when an oral contraceptive combination medicinal product (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol/0.15 mg levonorgestrel) was co-administered with semaglutide. Exposure of ethinylestradiol was not affected; an increase of 20% was observed for levonorgestrel exposure at steady state. Cmax was not affected for any of the compounds.

Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38%. This was assessed not to be clinically relevant. Digoxin Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure or Cmax of digoxin following a single dose of digoxin (0.5 mg). Metformin Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure or Cmax of metformin following dosing of 500 mg twice daily over 3.5 days. Warfarin and other coumarin derivatives Semaglutide did not change overall exposure or Cmax of R- and S-warfarin following a single dose of warfarin (25 mg), and the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin as measured by the international normalised ratio (INR) were not affected in a clinically"}

Metformin Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure or Cmax of metformin following dosing of 500 mg twice daily over 3.5 days. Warfarin and other coumarin derivatives Semaglutide did not change overall exposure or Cmax of R- and S-warfarin following a single dose of warfarin (25 mg), and the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin as measured by the international normalised ratio (INR) were not affected in a clinically relevant manner. However, cases of decreased INR have been reported during concomitant use of acenocoumarol and semaglutide. Upon initiation of semaglutide treatment in patients on warfarin or other coumarin derivatives, frequent monitoring of INR is recommended. 4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation Effects on fertility The effect of semaglutide on fertility in humans is unknown. Semaglutide did not affect male fertility in rats at daily SC doses of 828 μg/kg, resulting in exposures approximately 13 times the clinical AUC. In female rats, an increase in oestrous length and a small reduction in number of ovulations were observed at doses associated with maternal body weight loss (≥30 μg/kg/day SC, resulting in subclinical exposures). Use in pregnancy Pregnancy Category: D Semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential are recommended to use contraception when treated with semaglutide. If a patient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, semaglutide should be discontinued. Semaglutide should be discontinued at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long half-life (see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties). Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity when semaglutide was administered during organogenesis. In pregnant rats, embryofetal toxicity (lethality, impaired growth and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities) was observed at subclinical plasma exposures. Mechanistic studies suggest a direct GLP-1 receptor mediated role of semaglutide on some of the effects in rats (species specific). In pregnant rabbits, pharmacologically mediated reductions in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels. Early pregnancy losses and increased incidences of minor visceral (kidney, liver) and Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 6 of 34 skeletal (sternebra) fetal abnormalities were observed at ≥0.0025 mg/kg/day, at clinically relevant exposures. In pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, pharmacologically mediated, marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities (vertebra, sternebra, ribs) and with an increase in early pregnancy losses at ≥0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (>2.7 fold clinical exposure at 1 mg/week). Exposures at the NOAEL in all species were subclinical and a direct effect of semaglutide on the fetus cannot be excluded. Use in lactation In lactating rats, semaglutide was excreted in milk. A risk to a breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Semaglutide should not be used during breast-feeding. Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines 4.7 Ozempic has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. When it is used in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines. Adverse effects of Ozempic include dizziness which could affect the ability to drive or use machines (see Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects). 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects) Summary of the Safety Profile In 8 phase 3a trials, 4,792 patients were exposed to Ozempic alone or in combination with other glucose lowering medicinal products. The duration of the treatment ranged from 30 weeks to 2 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials were gastrointestinal disorders, including nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. In general, these reactions were mild or moderate in severity and of short duration. Reporting suspected adverse effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions at www.tga.gov.au/reporting-problems.

Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 8 of 34 2-year cardiovascular outcomes and safety trial In a high cardiovascular risk population, the adverse reaction profile was similar to that seen in the other phase 3a trials (described in section 5.1 Pharmacokinetic Properties). Description of Selected Adverse Reactions Hypoglycaemia No episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were observed when Ozempic was used as monotherapy. Severe hypoglycaemia was primarily observed when Ozempic was used with a sulfonylurea (1.2% of subjects, 0.03 events/patient year) or insulin (1.5% of subjects, 0.02 events/patient year). Few severe episodes (0.1% of subjects, 0.001 events/patient year) were observed with Ozempic in combination with oral antidiabetics other than sulfonylureas. Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Nausea occurred in 17.0% and 19.9% patients when treated with Ozempic 0.5 mg and 1 mg respectively, diarrhoea in 12.2% and 13.3% and vomiting in 6.4% and 8.4%. Most events were mild to moderate in severity and of short duration. The events led to treatment discontinuation in 3.9% and 5.9% of subjects. The events were most frequently reported during the first months on treatment. Patients with low body weight may experience more gastrointestinal side effects when treated with semaglutide. Acute pancreatitis The frequency of adjudication-confirmed acute pancreatitis reported in phase 3a clinical trials was 0.3% for semaglutide and 0.2% for the comparator, respectively. In the 2-year cardiovascular outcomes trial the frequency of acute pancreatitis confirmed by adjudication was 0.5% for semaglutide and 0.6% for placebo (see section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use). Diabetic Retinopathy Complications In a 2-year clinical trial involving 3,297 patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, long duration of diabetes and poorly controlled blood glucose, adjudicated events of diabetic retinopathy complications occurred in more patients treated with Ozempic (3.0%) compared to placebo (1.8%). The treatment difference appeared early and persisted throughout the trial. The absolute risk increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy treated with insulin at baseline. In the patients that did not have a documented history of diabetic retinopathy the number of events were similar for Ozempic and placebo. In other clinical trials up to 1 year involving 4,807 patients with type 2 diabetes patients, adverse events related to diabetic retinopathy were reported in similar proportions of subjects treated with Ozempic (1.7%) and comparators (2.0%). Discontinuation Due to an Adverse Event The incidence of discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events was 6.1% and 8.7% for patients treated with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg respectively, versus 1.5% for placebo. The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation were gastrointestinal. Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 9 of 34 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions (e.g. injection site rash, erythema) have been reported by 0.6% and 0.5% of patients receiving semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg respectively. A similar rate of injection site reactions was experienced by patients receiving placebo. These reactions have usually been mild. Immunogenicity Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing proteins or peptides, patients may develop antibodies following treatment with semaglutide. The proportion of patients tested positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies at any time point post-baseline was low (1-2%) and no patients had anti-semaglutide neutralising antibodies or anti-semaglutide antibodies with endogenous GLP-1 neutralising effect at end-of-trial. Heart Rate Increase Increased heart rate has been observed with GLP-1 receptor agonists. In the phase 3a trials, mean increases of 1 to 6 beats per minute (bpm) from a baseline of 72 to 76 bpm were observed in subjects treated with semaglutide. In a long-term trial in subjects with cardiovascular risk factors, 16% of semaglutide-treated subjects had an increase in heart rate of >10 bpm compared to 11% of subjects on placebo after 2 years of treatment. Increases in Amylase and Lipase In placebo-controlled trials, patients exposed to semaglutide had a mean increase from baseline in amylase of 13% and lipase of 22%. These changes were not observed in placebo- treated patients. In the absence of other signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic enzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis. Cholelithiasis In placebo-controlled trials, cholelithiasis was reported in 1.5% and 0.4% of patients-treated with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg respectively. Cholelithiasis was not reported"}

The most commonly reported adverse event was nausea. All patients recovered without complications. Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 10 of 34 There is no specific antidote for overdose with Ozempic. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient’s clinical signs and symptoms. A prolonged period of observation and treatment for these symptoms may be necessary, taking into account the long half-life of Ozempic of approximately 1 week (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). For information on the management of overdose, contact the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 (Australia). 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Pharmacodynamic Properties 5.1 Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, ATC code: A10BJ06. Mechanism of action Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence homology to human GLP-1. Semaglutide acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist that binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for native GLP-1. GLP-1 is a physiological hormone that has multiple actions in glucose and appetite regulation, in the cardiovascular system, and in the kidneys. The glucose and appetite effects are specifically mediated via GLP-1 receptors in the pancreas and the brain. GLP-1 receptors are also expressed in the heart, vasculature and immune system and kidney from where it may mediate cardiovascular and microvascular effects. Compared to native GLP-1, semaglutide has a prolonged half-life of around 1 week making it suitable for once weekly s.c. administration. The principal mechanism of protraction is albumin binding, which results in decreased renal clearance and protection from metabolic degradation. Furthermore, semaglutide is stabilised against degradation by the DPP-4 enzyme. Semaglutide reduces blood glucose through a mechanism where it stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, both in a glucose-dependent manner. Thus, when blood glucose is high, insulin secretion is stimulated and glucagon secretion is inhibited. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying in the early postprandial phase. During hypoglycaemia semaglutide diminishes insulin secretion and does not impair glucagon secretion. Semaglutide reduces body weight and body fat mass through lowered energy intake, involving an overall reduced appetite, which includes increased satiety and reduced hunger, as well as improved control of eating and decreased food cravings. Insulin resistance is also reduced, probably through reduction in body weight. In addition, semaglutide reduces the preference for high fat foods. Semaglutide had a beneficial effect on plasma lipids, lowered systolic blood pressure and reduced inflammation in clinical studies. Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 11 of 34 In animal studies, semaglutide attenuates the development of atherosclerosis by preventing aortic plaque progression and reducing inflammation in the plaque. Clinical data showed that semaglutide lowered albuminuria in patients with kidney disease. Pharmacodynamic Effects All pharmacodynamic evaluations were performed after 12 weeks of treatment (including dose escalation) at steady state with semaglutide 1 mg once weekly. Fasting and Postprandial Glucose Semaglutide reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with semaglutide 1 mg resulted in reductions in glucose in terms of absolute change from baseline (mmol/L / mg/dL) and relative reduction compared to placebo (%) for fasting glucose (1.6 mmol/L / 29 mg/dL; 22%), 2 hour postprandial glucose (4.1mmol/L / 74 mg/dL; 37%), mean 24 hour glucose concentration (1.7 mmol/L / 30 mg/dL; 22% reduction) and postprandial glucose excursions over 3 meals (0.6-1.1mmol/L / 11-20 mg/dL) compared to placebo (see Figure 2). Semaglutide lowered fasting glucose after the first dose. Figure 2: Mean 24 hour plasma glucose profiles (standardised meals) in patients with type 2 diabetes before (baseline) and after 12 weeks of treatment with semaglutide or placebo Beta-cell function and insulin secretion Semaglutide improves beta-cell function. Semaglutide, compared to placebo, improved first- and second-phase insulin response, with a 3- and 2-fold increase, respectively, following an intravenous bolus of glucose, and increased maximal beta-cell secretory capacity after an arginine stimulation test in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, semaglutide treatment increased fasting insulin concentrations compared to placebo. Glucagon Secretion Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 12 of 34 Time since start of breakfast meal (hours) Semaglutide - baseline (n=37) Plasma glucose (mmol/L) Placebo - baseline (n=38) Semaglutide 1 mg - end of treatment (n=36) Placebo - end of treatment (n=37) Plasma glucose (mg/dL) Semaglutide lowers the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, semaglutide resulted in the following relative reductions in glucagon compared to placebo: fasting glucagon (8-21%), postprandial glucagon response (14-15%) and mean 24 hour glucagon concentration (12%). Glucose Dependent Insulin and Glucagon Secretion Semaglutide lowered high blood glucose concentrations by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion in a glucose dependent manner. With semaglutide, the insulin secretion rate in patients with type 2 diabetes was comparable to that of healthy subjects (see Figure 3). Figure 3: Mean insulin secretion rate versus glucose concentration in patients with type 2 diabetes during graded glucose infusion before (baseline) and after 12 weeks of treatment with semaglutide or placebo and in untreated healthy subjects During induced hypoglycaemia, semaglutide compared to placebo did not alter the counter regulatory responses of increased glucagon, and did not impair the decrease of C-peptide in patients with type 2 diabetes. Gastric Emptying Semaglutide caused a minor delay of early postprandial gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which glucose appears in the circulation postprandially. Body Weight and Body Composition A greater reduction in body weight was observed with semaglutide compared to studied comparators (placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide ER and insulin glargine) (section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties). The body weight loss with semaglutide was predominantly from fat tissue with loss of fat mass being 3-fold larger than loss of lean mass. Appetite, Energy Intake and Food Choice Semaglutide compared to placebo lowered the energy intake of 3 consecutive ad libitum meals by 18-35%. This was supported by a semaglutide-induced suppression of appetite in Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 13 of 34 Plasma glucose (mmol/L) Semaglutide - baseline (n=37) Placebo - baseline (n=38) Semaglutide 1 mg - end of treatment (n=36) Placebo - end of treatment (n=37) Insulin secretion rate (pmol/kg/min) Plasma glucose (mg/dL) Insulin secretion rate (pmol/kg/min) Healthy subjects (n=12) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the fasting state as well as postprandially, improved control of eating, less food cravings and a relative lower preference for high fat food. Fasting and Postprandial Lipids Semaglutide compared to placebo lowered fasting triglyceride and VLDL cholesterol concentrations by 12% and 21%, respectively. The postprandial triglyceride and VLDL cholesterol response to a high fat meal was reduced by >40%. Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) The effect of semaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc trial. Semaglutide did not prolong QTc intervals at supra-therapeutic dose levels (up to 1.5 mg at steady state). Clinical trials Improvement of glycaemic control, reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and risk reduction of chronic kidney disease progression are integral parts of the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of Ozempic 0.5 mg and 1 mg once weekly were evaluated in six randomised controlled phase 3a trials. Of these, five trials (SUSTAIN 1-5) had glycaemic efficacy assessment as the primary objective, while one trial (SUSTAIN 6) had cardiovascular outcome as the primary objective. Additionally, two phase 3 trials were conducted with Ozempic in Japanese patients with safety as the primary objective and efficacy the secondary objective. The trials included in total 8,124 randomised patients with type 2 diabetes (4,792 treated with semaglutide). An additional trial including 1,201 patients was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of Ozempic 0.5 mg and 1 mg once weekly versus dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg once weekly, respectively. A phase 3b kidney outcomes trials (FLOW) including 3,533 patients was conducted to investigate the effects of semaglutide 1 mg once weekly versus placebo on the progression of kidney impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Treatment with Ozempic demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c (see Figure 4) and body weight maintained for up to 2 years compared to placebo and active control treatment (sitagliptin, insulin glargine, exenatide ER and dulaglutide).

There were 123 patients on sulfonylurea monotherapy at baseline. HbA1c at baseline was 8.2%, 8.4% and 8.4% for Ozempic 0.5 mg, Ozempic 1 mg, and placebo, respectively. At week 30, the change in HbA1c was -1.6%, -1.5% and 0.1% for Ozempic 0.5 mg, Ozempic 1 mg, and placebo, respectively. Combination with premix insulin ± 1–2 OADs In SUSTAIN 6 (see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties – Clinical Trials), a subgroup on premix insulin (with or without 2 OADs) was evaluated at week 30. There were 867 patients on premix insulin at baseline. HbA1c at baseline was 8.8%, 8.9% and 8.9% for Ozempic 0.5 mg, Ozempic 1 mg, and placebo, respectively. At week 30, the change in HbA1c was -1.3%, -1.8% and -0.4% for Ozempic 0.5 mg, Ozempic 1 mg, and placebo, respectively. Body Weight Ozempic 1 mg used as monotherapy or in combination with 1-2 medicinal products resulted in statistically superior reductions in body weight up to 6.5 kg, compared to patients receiving placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide ER, insulin glargine or dulaglutide (Tables 3 to 7). The reduction in body weight was sustained for up to 2 years (Figure 7). Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 23 of 34 Figure 7: Mean change in body weight (kg) over time in SUSTAIN 6 In the kidney outcomes trial FLOW, treatment with semaglutide 1 mg resulted in a sustained reduction in body weight at week 104 vs placebo, in addition to standard-of-care (-5.6 kg for semaglutide vs -1.4 kg for placebo). Fasting plasma glucose and Postprandial increments Ozempic 0.5 mg and 1 mg showed significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose levels of up to 2.8 mmol/L and reductions in postprandial increments across all three daily meals (difference between pre-meal and post-meal values from three meals) of up to 1.2 mmol/L (in addition see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties). Beta-cell function and insulin resistance Beta-cell function measured by homeostasis model assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance measured by homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) overall improved with Ozempic 0.5 mg and 1 mg (in addition see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties). Lipids Overall, improvements in the fasting blood lipid profile were seen with Ozempic treatment across trials, mostly for the 1 mg group (in addition see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties). Prevention of cardiovascular disease In a 104-week double-blind trial (SUSTAIN 6), 3,297 patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk were randomised to Ozempic 0.5 mg or 1 mg once weekly or placebo 0.5 mg or placebo 1 mg in addition to standard-of-care hereafter followed for 2 years. In total 98.0% of the patients completed the trial and the vital status was known at the end of the trial for 99.6% of the patients. The trial population was distributed by age as: 1,598 patients ( 8.5%) ≥65 years, 321 (9.7%) ≥75 years and 20 (0.6%) ≥85 years. There were 2,358 patients with normal or mild renal impairment, 832 with moderate and 107 with severe or end stage renal impairment.

The mean duration of diabetes was 13.9 years. The primary endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE): cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non- fatal stroke. The secondary endpoint was time from randomisation to first occurrence of an expanded composite cardiovascular outcome, defined as MACE, revascularisation (coronary and peripheral), unstable angina requiring hospitalisation or hospitalisation for heart failure. The total number of primary component MACE endpoints was 254, including 108 (6.6%) with Ozempic and 146 (8.9%) with placebo. Treatment with Ozempic resulted in a 26% risk reduction in the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. This was mainly driven by 39% decrease in the rate of non-fatal stroke and a 26% decrease in non- fatal myocardial infarction with no difference in cardiovascular death (see Figure 8).

The hazard ratio for time to nephropathy (new onset of persistent macroalbuminuria, persistent doubling of serum creatinine, need for continuous renal replacement therapy and death due to renal disease) was 0.64 [0.46; 0.88] driven by new onset of persistent macroalbuminuria. A significant and sustained reduction in HbA1c from baseline to week 104 was observed with Ozempic 0.5 mg and 1 mg vs placebo 0.5 mg and 1 mg, in addition to standard-of-care (-1.1 and -1.4 vs -0.4 and -0.4, respectively). Blood Pressure Significant reductions in mean systolic blood pressure were observed when Ozempic 0.5 mg (3.5–5.1 mmHg) and Ozempic 1 mg (5.4-7.3 mmHg) were used in combination with oral antidiabetic medicinal products or basal insulin.

Patients treated with Ozempic 0.5 mg and 1 mg had a significant decrease in body weight compared to that of patients treated with sitagliptin (-2.2 kg and -3.9 kg vs 0.0 kg). The most frequently reported adverse reactions (ARs) in this trial were gastrointestinal disorders. Greater proportions of patients treated with Ozempic 0.5 mg and 1 mg experienced gastrointestinal disorders vs patients treated with sitagliptin (38% and 41% for Ozempic 0.5 mg and 1 mg vs 17% with sitagliptin). In an open label trial comparing the safety (primary objective) and efficacy (secondary objective) of Ozempic 0.5 mg and 1 mg once weekly with 1-2 OADs in 601 Japanese patients on monotherapy or 1 OAD, a higher reduction in HbA1c was seen with Ozempic 0.5 mg (- 1.7%) and 1 mg (-2.0%) compared to additional OAD (-0.7%). Patients treated with Ozempic 0.5 mg and 1 mg had a significant decrease in body weight compared to that of patients treated with additional OAD (-1.4 kg and -3.2 kg vs +0.4 kg). The most frequently reported ARs in this trial were gastrointestinal disorders. Greater proportion of patients treated with Ozempic 0.5 mg and 1 mg experienced gastrointestinal disorders vs patients treated with additional OAD (54% and 54% vs 20%). FLOW Trial (Chronic Kidney Disease) Ozempic vs placebo on progression of kidney impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The phase 3b kidney outcomes trial FLOW was a multi-centre, international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, and event-driven trial in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease with a baseline eGFR of 50 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m2 and a UACR of >300 and <5000 mg/g, or eGFR 25 to <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 and a UACR of >100 and <5000 mg/g. The FLOW trial evaluated the effect of semaglutide 1 mg once weekly compared with the corresponding placebo, in addition to standard-of-care, using the primary composite outcome of persistent ≥50% reduction in eGFR, persistent eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation), kidney death or cardiovascular death. The study was stopped early for efficacy following the planned interim analysis based on a recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring Committee. A total of 3,533 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either semaglutide 1 mg or placebo and followed for a median of 40.9 months. The mean age of the population was 66.6 years and 69.7% were male. 65.8% were White and 23.9% were Asian. The mean baseline BMI was 32.0 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes at baseline was 17.4 years and mean baseline HbA1c was 7.8% (61.5 mmol/mol). The mean baseline eGFR was 47 mL/min/1.73 m2 with 11.3% of patients having an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. The median UACR was 568 mg/g with 68.5% of patients with a UACR ≥300 mg/g. At baseline, about 95% of the patients were treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and 16% with sodium-glucose cotransporter2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 27 of 34 Ozempic was superior to placebo, in addition to standard-of-care, in preventing the primary composite outcome of persistent ≥50% reduction in eGFR, onset of persistent eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy, kidney death or cardiovascular death. The hazard ratio [95% CI] for time to first occurrence of the primary composite outcome was 0.76 [0.66; 0.88]; corresponding to a relative risk reduction in kidney disease progression of 24% (see Figure 10). The individual components of the primary composite contributed to the treatment effect. There were only a small number of kidney deaths in the trial (see Figure 11: Forest plot: analyses of time to first occurrence of the primary composite outcome and its components, first occurrence of MACE and its components and all cause death (FLOW)). The treatment benefit of Ozempic over placebo on the primary composite outcome was generally consistent across the pre-specified subgroups. Ozempic showed superiority over placebo, in addition to standard-of-care, in reducing the yearly rate of change in eGFR with an estimated treatment difference of 1.16 (mL/min/1.73m2/year) [0.86; 1.47]95%CI (-2.19 for semaglutide and -3.36 for placebo). Figure 10: Cumulative incidence function of time to first occurrence of the primary composite outcome: onset of persistent ≥50% reduction in eGFR, onset of persistent eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy, kidney death or cardiovascular death (FLOW) Ozempic showed superiority over placebo, in addition to standard-of-care, in reducing the risk of MACE (using a composite outcome consisting of: non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or CV death) with a HR of 0.82 ([0.68; 0.98]95%CI; ) (see Figure 11). Treatment with Ozempic, in addition to standard-of-care, reduced all-cause mortality with a HR of 0.80 ([0.67, 0.95]95%CI) and reduced the risk of CV death with a HR of 0.71 ([0.56, 0.89]95%CI) (Figure 11).

Absorption Maximum concentration was reached 1 to 3 days post dose. Steady-state exposure was achieved following 4-5 weeks of once weekly administration. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the mean steady state concentrations following s.c. administration of 0.5 mg and 1 mg semaglutide were approximately 16 nmol/L and 30 nmol/L, respectively. Semaglutide exposure increased in a dose proportional manner for doses of 0.5 mg and 1 mg. Similar exposure was achieved with s.c. administration of semaglutide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Absolute bioavailability of s.c semaglutide was 89%. Distribution The mean volume of distribution of semaglutide following s.c. administration in patients with type 2 diabetes was approximately 12.5 L. Semaglutide was extensively bound to plasma albumin (>99%). Metabolism Semaglutide is metabolised through proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential beta-oxidation of the fatty acid sidechain. Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 29 of 34 Excretion The primary excretion routes of semaglutide related material were via the urine and faeces. Approximately 3% of the dose was excreted as intact semaglutide via urine. Clearance of semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes was approximately 0.05 L/h. With an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week, semaglutide will be present in the circulation for about 5 weeks after the last dose. Special Populations No dose adjustment of semaglutide is needed based on age, gender, race, ethnicity, body weight, or renal or hepatic impairment. The effects of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide are shown in Figure 12 Figure 12: Impact of intrinsic factors on semaglutide exposure Age Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide based on data from phase 3a studies including patients of 20-86 years of age. Gender Gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. Race Race (White, Black or African-American, Asian) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. Ethnicity Ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide.

This was shown with a single dose of 0.5 mg semaglutide for patients with different degrees of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe or patients in dialysis) compared with subjects with normal renal function. This was also shown for subjects with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment based on data from phase 3a studies (Figure 10), although the experience in patients with end-stage renal disease was limited. Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment did not have any impact on the exposure of semaglutide. The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide were evaluated in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, severe) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function in a study with a single-dose of 0.5 mg semaglutide. Paediatrics Semaglutide has not been studied in paediatric patients. 5.3 Preclinical Safety Data Genotoxicity Semaglutide was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, and was not clastogenic in vitro (cytogenetic assay in human lymphocytes), or in vivo (rat bone marrow micronucleus test). Carcinogenicity Non-lethal thyroid C-cell tumours observed in rodents are a class effect for GLP-1 receptor agonists. In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, semaglutide caused thyroid C-cell tumours at clinically relevant exposures (at ≥ x the clinical AUC in mice [based on the plasma AUC at the maximum recommended human dose of 1 mg/week] and subclinical exposures in rats; a no effect level was not established in either species). No other treatment-related tumours were observed. The rodent C-cell tumours are caused by a non- genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. The relevance for humans is considered to be low, but cannot be completely excluded. Juvenile toxicity In juvenile rats, semaglutide caused delayed sexual maturation in both males and females. These delays had no impact upon fertility and reproductive capacity of either sex, or on the ability of the females to maintain pregnancy. Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 31 of 34 6.

Product details How do I use Ozempic®? 1. Why am I using Ozempic®? Ozempic® contains the active ingredient semaglutide. Ozempic® belongs to a group of medicines called 'GLP-1 receptor agonists' which help control how the pancreas works. Ozempic® is an injection that is used once a week. Ozempic® is used to lower blood sugar (glucose) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Ozempic® is also used to reduce the risk that your kidney disease worsens if you have type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Diabetes mellitus is a condition where your pancreas does not produce enough insulin to control the level of sugar in your blood or, your body is not able to use the insulin it makes properly. Ozempic® helps your body to produce more insulin when your blood sugar level is high. Ozempic® is used on its own if your blood sugar is not properly controlled by diet and exercise alone. Ozempic® is also able to be used with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood sugar levels. These medicines may include oral antidiabetics (such as metformin, thiazolidinedione medicines (TZD’s), sulfonylurea medicines, SGLT2 inhibitor medicines such as Jardiance®) or insulin. It is important that you keep following any diet and lifestyle advice from your doctor, diabetes education nurse or pharmacist while using Ozempic®.

Clear and colourless isotonic solution; pH=7.4. 4 CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS Weight Management Adults Wegovy is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-energy diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management (including weight loss and weight maintenance) in adults with an initial Body Mass Index (BMI) of • ≥30 kg/m2 (obesity), or • ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbidity (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties – Clinical trials). Adolescents Wegovy is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adolescents ages 12 years and above with initial: • obesity* and • body weight above 60 kg Treatment with Wegovy should be re-evaluated and discontinued if adolescent patients have not reduced their BMI by at least 5% after 12 weeks on the 2.4 mg or maximum tolerated dose. *Obesity (BMI ≥ 95th percentile) as defined on sex- and age-specific BMI growth charts (CDC.gov) (see Table 1). Table 1 BMI cut-off points for obesity (≥95th percentile) by sex and age for paediatric patients aged 12 and older (CDC criteria) Age (years) 12 12.5 13 13.5 14 14.5 15 15.5 16 16.5 17 17.5 BMI (kg/m2) at 95th Percentile Males 24.2 24.7 25.1 25.6 26.0 26.4 26.8 27.2 27.5 27.9 28.2 28.6 Females 25.2 25.7 26.3 26.8 27.2 27.7 28.1 28.5 28.9 29.3 29.6 30.0 Wegovy® Product Information Page 2 of 42 Reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events Wegovy is indicated as an adjunct to standard of care therapy to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) in adults with established cardiovascular disease, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m2, and without established Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties – Clinical trials). 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION The recommended maintenance dose is 2.4 mg once weekly. The maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly is reached by starting with a weekly dose of 0.25 mg. To reduce the likelihood of gastrointestinal symptoms, the dose should be escalated over a 16-week period to a maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly (see Table 2). In case of significant gastrointestinal symptoms, consider delaying dose escalation until symptoms have improved. If patients do not tolerate the 2.4 mg dose, the dose can be decreased to a 1.7 mg weekly dose for maintenance. Patients should re-escalate the dose to 2.4 mg weekly, if tolerated. Weekly doses higher than 2.4 mg are not recommended. Table 2 Dose escalation schedule Weekly dose 0.25 mg 0.5 mg 1 mg 1.7 mg 2.4 mg Dose escalation Week 1-4 Week 5-8 Week 9-12 Week 13-16 Maintenance dose Method of administration Wegovy is administered once weekly at any time of the day, with or without meals. Wegovy is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, in the thigh or in the upper arm. The injection site can be changed without dose adjustment. Wegovy should not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. The day of weekly administration can be changed if necessary, as long as the time between two doses is at least 3 days (>72 hours). After selecting a new dosing day, once-weekly dosing should be continued. Patients should be advised to read the instruction for use included in the package leaflet carefully before administering Wegovy. Single-dose pen The single-dose pen is for single use in one patient only. The single-dose pen should be discarded after use. When administering semaglutide, the pen should be pressed firmly against the skin until the yellow bar has stopped moving. The injection takes about 5-10 seconds. FlexTouch pen The Wegovy FlexTouch pen is for use by one patient only. It contains 4 doses. A new needle should be attached for each use. The needle should be discarded after each use. Missed Dose If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible and within 5 days after the missed dose. If more than 5 days have passed, the missed dose should be skipped, and the next dose should be administered on the regularly scheduled day of the week. In each case, patients can then resume Wegovy® Product Information Page 3 of 42 their regular once weekly dosing schedule. If more doses are missed, reducing the starting dose for re-initiation should be considered. Special Populations Patients with Type 2 diabetes: Wegovy should not be used in combination with other GLP-1 receptor agonist products. When initiating Wegovy, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin or insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Elderly (≥ 65 years old) No dose adjustment is required based on age. Therapeutic experience in patients ≥85 years of age is limited (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). Gender No dose adjustment is required based on gender. Race and Ethnicity No dose adjustment is required based on race and ethnicity. Patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. Experience with the use of semaglutide in patients with severe (CrCL <30 mL/min) renal impairment is limited. Semaglutide is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). Experience with the use of semaglutide in patients with severe hepatic impairment is limited. Caution should be exercised when treating these patients with semaglutide. Children and adolescents Safety and efficacy of Wegovy in children below 12 years have not been studied. For adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, the same dose escalation schedule as for adults should be applied (see Table 2). The dose should be increased until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg weekly or a lower maximum tolerated dose has been reached. Weekly doses higher than 2.4 mg are not recommended. It is recommended to regularly review the goals of treatment with Wegovy, particularly once the target weight (e.g. BMI <85th percentile) has been achieved. 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (List of Excipients). 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE Aspiration in association with general anaesthesia or deep sedation Cases of pulmonary aspiration have been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 RAs undergoing general anaesthesia (GA) or deep sedation despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. Therefore, the increased risk of residual gastric content because of delayed gastric emptying should be considered prior to performing procedures with GA or deep sedation. Wegovy® Product Information Page 4 of 42 Gastrointestinal effects and dehydration Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions. This should be considered when treating patients with impaired renal function as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may cause dehydration which could cause a deterioration of renal function. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure, which have in some cases required haemodialysis, in patients treated with semaglutide. Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis, has been observed with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, Wegovy should be discontinued; if confirmed, Wegovy should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with Wegovy is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Populations not studied The safety and efficacy of Wegovy have not been investigated in patients: treated with other products for weight management, • • with type 1 diabetes, • with congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV. The use of semaglutide is not recommended in these patients. There is limited experience with Wegovy in patients: • aged 85 years or more, • with inflammatory bowel disease, • with diabetic gastroparesis. Use with caution in these patients. Patients with type 2 diabetes Wegovy must not be used as a substitute for insulin in patients with diabetes. Semaglutide should not be used in combination with other GLP-1 receptor agonist products. It has not been evaluated and an increased risk of adverse reactions related to overdose is considered likely. Hypoglycaemia in patients with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes Insulin and sulfonylurea are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Patients treated with Wegovy in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia can be lowered by reducing the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin when initiating treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonists. The addition of Wegovy in patients treated with insulin has not"}

Hypoglycaemia in patients with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes Insulin and sulfonylurea are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Patients treated with Wegovy in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia can be lowered by reducing the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin when initiating treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonists. The addition of Wegovy in patients treated with insulin has not been evaluated. Diabetic retinopathy in patients with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Long-term glycaemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for worsening and treated according to local clinical guidelines. There is no experience with Wegovy in patients with type 2 diabetes with Wegovy® Product Information Page 5 of 42 uncontrolled or potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy. In these patients, treatment with Wegovy is not recommended. Use in the elderly See section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties. Paediatric use Safety and efficacy of Wegovy in children below 12 years have not been studied. Use in renal impairment Experience with the use of semaglutide in patients with severe (CrCL <30 mL/min) renal impairment is limited. Semaglutide is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease (see sections 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties and 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). Use in hepatic impairment Experience with the use of semaglutide in patients with severe hepatic impairment is limited. Caution should be exercised when treating these patients with semaglutide. Effects on laboratory tests No data available. 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS In vitro studies have shown very low potential for semaglutide to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes, and to inhibit drug transporters. The delay of gastric emptying with semaglutide may influence the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products; therefore, semaglutide should be used with caution in patients receiving oral medicinal products that require rapid gastrointestinal absorption. No clinically relevant effect on the rate of gastric emptying was observed with semaglutide 2.4 mg. In clinical pharmacology trials assessing the effect of semaglutide 1.0 mg on the absorption of co- administered oral medications at steady state no clinically relevant drug-drug interactions with semaglutide (Figure 1) was observed based on the evaluated medications. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required when co-administered with semaglutide. Figure 1 (Forest Plot) - Impact of semaglutide on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medications Wegovy® Product Information Page 6 of 42 Co-administered medication Metformin S-warfarin R-warfarin Digoxin Atorvastatin Ethinylestradiol Levonorgestrel AUC0-12h Cmax AUC0-168h Cmax AUC0-168h Cmax AUC0-120h Cmax AUC0-72h Cmax AUC0-24h Cmax AUC0-24h Cmax 0.5 1 2 Relative exposure Ratio and 90% CI Recommendation No dose adjustment No dose adjustment No dose adjustment No dose adjustment No dose adjustment No dose adjustment No dose adjustment Relative exposure in terms of AUC and Cmax for each medication when given with semaglutide compared to without semaglutide. Metformin and oral contraceptive drug (ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel) were assessed at steady state. Warfarin (S-warfarin/R-warfarin), digoxin and atorvastatin were assessed after a single dose. Abbreviations: AUC: area under the curve. Cmax: maximum concentration. CI: confidence interval Oral contraceptives Semaglutide is not anticipated to decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives as semaglutide did not change the overall exposure of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel to a clinically relevant degree, when an oral contraceptive combination medicinal product (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol/0.15 mg levonorgestrel) was co-administered with semaglutide. Exposure of ethinylestradiol was not affected; an increase of 20% was observed for levonorgestrel exposure at steady state. Cmax was not affected for any of the compounds. Atorvastatin Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure of atorvastatin following a single dose administration of atorvastatin (40 mg). Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38%. This was assessed not to be clinically relevant. Digoxin Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure or Cmax of digoxin following a single dose of digoxin (0.5 mg). Metformin Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure or Cmax of metformin following dosing of 500 mg twice daily over 3.5 days. Warfarin and other coumarin derivatives Semaglutide did not change overall exposure or Cmax of R- and S-warfarin following a single dose of warfarin (25 mg), and the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarin as measured by the international normalised ratio (INR) were not affected in a clinically relevant manner. However, cases of decreased INR have been reported during concomitant use of acenocoumarol and semaglutide. Upon initiation of semaglutide treatment in patients on warfarin or other coumarin derivatives, frequent monitoring of INR is recommended. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on fertility The effect of semaglutide on fertility in humans is unknown. Semaglutide did not affect male fertility in rats at daily subcutaneous (s.c.) doses of 828 μg/kg, resulting in exposures approximately 4.5 times the clinical AUC. In female rats, an increase in oestrous length and a small reduction in number of ovulations were observed at doses associated with maternal body weight loss (≥30 μg/kg/day SC, resulting in subclinical exposures). Use in pregnancy – Pregnancy Category D Semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential are recommended to use contraception when treated with semaglutide. If a patient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, semaglutide should be discontinued. Semaglutide should be discontinued at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long half-life (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity when semaglutide was administered during organogenesis. In pregnant rats, embryofetal toxicity (lethality, impaired growth and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities) was observed at subclinical plasma exposures. Mechanistic studies suggest a direct GLP-1 receptor mediated role of semaglutide on some of the effects in rats (species Wegovy® Product Information Page 7 of 42 specific). In pregnant rabbits, pharmacologically mediated reductions in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels. Early pregnancy losses and increased incidences of minor visceral (kidney, liver) and skeletal (sternebra) fetal abnormalities were observed at ≥0.0025 mg/kg/day, at clinically relevant exposures. In pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, pharmacologically mediated, marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities (vertebra, sternebra, ribs) and with an increase in early pregnancy losses at ≥0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (>1.4- fold clinical exposure at 2.4 mg/week). Exposures at the NOAEL in all species were subclinical and a direct effect of semaglutide on the fetus cannot be excluded. Use in lactation In lactating rats, semaglutide was excreted in milk. A risk to a breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Semaglutide should not be used during breast-feeding. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES Wegovy has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, dizziness can be experienced mainly during the dose escalation period. Driving or use of machines should be done cautiously if dizziness occurs. Effect on the ability to drive and use machines for patients with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes If Wegovy is used in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines. 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Summary of safety profile In 4 phase 3a trials, 2,650 adult patients were exposed to Wegovy. The duration of the trials were 68 weeks. Similar to other GLP-1 receptor agonists, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were gastrointestinal disorders including nausea, diarrhoea, constipation and vomiting. Reporting suspected adverse effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions at www.tga.gov.au/reporting- problems.

Over 68 weeks, nausea occurred in 43.9% of patients when treated with Wegovy (16.1% for placebo), diarrhoea in 29.7% (15.9% for placebo) and vomiting in 24.5% (6.3% for placebo). Most events were mild to moderate in severity and of short duration. Constipation occurred in 24.2% of patients treated with Wegovy (11.1% for placebo) and were mild to moderate in severity and of longer duration. In patients treated with semaglutide, the median duration of nausea was 8 days, 2 days for vomiting, 3 days for diarrhoea, and 47 days for constipation. Wegovy® Product Information Page 10 of 42 Other events that occurred at a higher incidence among WEGOVY-treated adult patients included dyspepsia, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, eructation, flatulence, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, haemorrhoids, and hiccups. Patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2) may experience more gastrointestinal effects when treated with semaglutide. The gastrointestinal events led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 4.3% of patients. Acute pancreatitis The frequency of adjudication-confirmed acute pancreatitis reported in phase 3a clinical trials was 0.2% for Wegovy and <0.1% for placebo, respectively. In SELECT, the cardiovascular outcome trial, the frequency of acute pancreatitis confirmed by adjudication was 0.2% for Wegovy and 0.3% for placebo. Acute gallstone disease/Cholelithiasis Cholelithiasis was reported in 1.6% and led to cholecystitis in 0.6% of patients treated with Wegovy. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis were reported in 1.1% and 0.3%, respectively, of patients treated with placebo. Hair loss Hair loss was reported in 2.5% of patients treated with Wegovy and in 1.0% of patients treated with placebo. The events were mainly of mild severity and most patients recovered while on continued treatment. Hair loss was reported more frequently in patients with a greater weight loss (≥ 20%). Increased heart rate In the phase 3a trials, a mean increase of 3 beats per minute (bpm) from a baseline mean of 72 bpm was observed in patients treated with Wegovy. The proportions of patients with a maximum increase from baseline ≥20 bpm at any timepoint during the on-treatment period were 26.0% in the Wegovy group vs 15.6% in the placebo group. Immunogenicity Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing proteins or peptides, patients may develop antibodies following treatment with semaglutide. The proportion of patients testing positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies at any time post-baseline was low (2.9%) and no patients had anti-semaglutide neutralising antibodies or anti-semaglutide antibodies with endogenous GLP-1 neutralising effect at end-of-trial. Dysaesthesia Events related to a clinical picture of altered skin sensation such as dysaesthesia, paraesthesia, hyperaesthesia, burning sensation, allodynia and sensitive skin were reported in 2.1% of patients treated with Wegovy injection and 1.2% of patients treated with placebo. The events were mild to moderate in severity and most patients recovered while on continued treatment. Fractures In SELECT, the cardiovascular outcomes trial in adults, more fractures of the hip and pelvis were reported on semaglutide than on placebo in female patients: 1.0% (24/2448) vs. 0.2% (5/2424), and in patients aged 75 years and older: 2.4% (17/703) vs. 0.6% (4/663), respectively. Urolithiasis In SELECT, the cardiovascular outcomes trial, 1.2% of semaglutide-treated patients and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo reported urolithiasis, including serious reactions that were reported more frequently among patients receiving semaglutide (0.6%) than placebo (0.4%). Wegovy® Product Information Page 11 of 42 Patients with type 2 diabetes Hypoglycaemia in patients with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes In STEP 2, clinically significant hypoglycaemia was observed in 6.2% (0.1 events/patient year) of subjects treated with Wegovy compared with 2.5% (0.03 events/patient year) of subjects treated with placebo. One episode (0.2% of subjects, 0.002 events/patient year) was reported as severe. The risk of hypoglycaemia was increased when Wegovy was used with a sulfonylurea. Diabetic retinopathy in patients with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes Few episodes of diabetic retinopathy (4.0 % vs 2.7% of patients treated with Wegovy vs placebo, respectively) were observed in STEP 2. Long-term glycaemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy. A 2-year clinical trial investigated semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg vs placebo in 3,297 patients with type 2 diabetes, with high cardiovascular risk, long duration of diabetes and poorly controlled blood glucose. In this trial, adjudicated events of diabetic retinopathy complications occurred in more patients treated with semaglutide (3.0%) compared to placebo (1.8%). This was observed in insulin-treated patients with known diabetic retinopathy. The treatment difference appeared early and persisted throughout the trial. In STEP 2, retinal disorders were reported by 6.9% of patients treated with Wegovy, 6.2% of patients treated with semaglutide 1 mg, and 4.2% of patients treated with placebo. The majority of events were reported as diabetic retinopathy (4.0%, 2.7%, and 2.7%, respectively) and non-proliferative retinopathy (0.7%, 0%, and 0%, respectively). Paediatric population In a clinical trial conducted in adolescents of 12 years to below 18 years with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, 133 patients were exposed to Wegovy. The trial duration was 68 weeks. Overall, the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in the adolescents were comparable to that observed in the adult population. Cholelithiasis was reported in 3.8% of patients treated with Wegovy. Semaglutide did not appear to affect growth or pubertal development during the trial period. To date, there are no long-term (beyond 68 weeks) clinical trial data on safety or efficacy in adolescents. Cardiovascular outcomes trial In SELECT, the cardiovascular outcomes trial, the adverse event profile of systematically collected adverse events was similar to that seen in the phase 3a trials (described in Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties – Clinical trials). Additional adverse events included urolithiasis and hip fractures. For non-systematically collected adverse events, no definite conclusions can be made. Post-market adverse effects • Gastrointestinal disorders: Intestinal obstruction* *Grouped term covering PTs Intestinal obstruction, Ileus, small intestinal obstruction 4.9 OVERDOSE Overdose with semaglutide may be associated with gastrointestinal disorders which could lead to dehydration. In the event of overdose the patient should be observed for clinical signs and appropriate supportive treatment initiated. A prolonged period of observation and treatment for Wegovy® Product Information Page 12 of 42 these symptoms may be necessary, taking into account the long half-life of Wegovy of approximately 1 week (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties).

Semaglutide acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist that binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for native GLP-1. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator and has multiple actions in glucose and appetite regulation. The glucose and appetite effects are specifically mediated via GLP-1 receptors in the pancreas and the brain. Clinical studies show that semaglutide reduces energy intake, increases feelings of satiety, fullness and control of eating, and reduces feelings of hunger, and frequency and intensity of cravings. Animal studies show that semaglutide works in the brain through the GLP-1 receptor. Semaglutide has direct effects on areas in the brain involved in homeostatic regulation of food intake in the hypothalamus and the brainstem. Semaglutide affects the hedonic reward system through direct and indirect effects in brain areas including the septum, thalamus and amygdala. Semaglutide has shown an effect to change food intake in animals away from more rewarding high fat, sweet items. Semaglutide orchestrates the homeostatic and hedonic contributions with executive function to regulate caloric intake, appetite, reward and food choice. In addition, in clinical studies semaglutide have shown to reduce blood glucose through a mechanism where it stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, both in a glucose- dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying in the early postprandial phase. During hypoglycaemia, semaglutide diminishes insulin secretion and does not impair glucagon secretion. The mechanism of action of semaglutide for cardiovascular risk reduction has not been established. Weight loss distribution In a sub-study in STEP 1 (N = 140), body composition was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The results of the DEXA assessment showed that treatment with Wegovy was accompanied by greater reduction in fat mass than in lean body mass leading to an improvement in body composition compared to placebo after 68 weeks. Furthermore, this reduction in total fat mass was accompanied by a reduction in visceral fat. In the semaglutide group, there was a mean (SD) decrease in total fat mass proportion of 3.9%-points (5.4%-points), an increase in lean body mass proportion of 3.4% (5.1%) and a decrease in regional visceral fat mass proportion of 2.2%-points (4.4%). These results suggest that most of the total weight loss was attributable to a reduction in fat tissue, including visceral fat. Appetite regulation, energy intake and food choice Wegovy reduces appetite by increasing feelings of fullness and satiety, while lowering hunger and prospective food consumption. In a phase 1 trial, energy intake during an ad libitum meal was 35% lower with Wegovy compared to placebo after 20 weeks of dosing. This was supported by improved control of eating, less food cravings (for dairy and savoury foods), less desire for sweet food and a relatively lower preference for high fat food.

The semaglutide exposure for subjects with overweight or obesity treated with Wegovy is comparable to the exposure evaluated in the semaglutide QTc study in healthy volunteers. Clinical trials The efficacy and safety of Wegovy for weight management in combination with a reduced calorie intake and increased physical activity were evaluated in four 68-week double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled phase 3a trials (STEP 1-4). A total of 4684 patients (2652 randomised to treatment with Wegovy) were included in these trials. Furthermore, the two-year efficacy and safety of Wegovy compared to placebo were evaluated in a double-blinded randomised placebo- controlled phase 3b trial (STEP 5) including 304 patients (152 on treatment with Wegovy). Treatment with Wegovy demonstrated superior, clinically meaningful, and sustained weight loss compared with placebo in patients with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity (Figure 2). Furthermore, across the trials, a higher proportion of patients achieved ≥5%, ≥10% and ≥15% weight loss with Wegovy compared with placebo. Treatment with Wegovy also showed statistically significant improvements in waist circumference and systolic blood pressure compared to placebo. Wegovy also showed statistically significant improvements in physical functioning compared to placebo, except for STEP 3 where the improvement was not statistically significant. Wegovy demonstrated efficacy in weight loss regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body weight, BMI, presence of type 2 diabetes and level of renal function. Figure 2 Body weight (%) change from baseline to week 68 and 104 Wegovy® Product Information Page 14 of 42 STEP 4 Sustained WM* *baseline for STEP 4 was defined as the start of the randomisation period at week 20 In addition, a dedicated cardiovascular outcomes trial, SELECT, has been conducted with semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly against placebo in patients with established cardiovascular disease, BMI ≥27 kg/m2 and without a history of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Treatment with semaglutide in SELECT resulted in a significant risk reduction (20%) in 3-component MACE (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) compared with placebo. STEP 1: Weight management In a 68-week double-blind trial, 1961 patients with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), or with overweight (BMI ≥27 to <30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity were randomised to Wegovy or placebo. All patients received counselling with regards to diet (500 kcal/2092 kJ deficit per day) relative to the estimated total energy expenditure (TEE) (calculated once at randomisation), and physical activity (150 min of physical activity per week was encouraged). At baseline, patients had a mean BMI of 37.9 kg/m2 and a mean body weight of 105.3 kg. The mean age of patients was 46 years. There were 75.1% Caucasian/White, 5.7% Black/African American, and 13.3% Asian. A total of 12.0% were Hispanic or Latino. The majority of patients had at least one weight-related comorbidity. These included, but were not limited to, pre-diabetes (43.7%), dyslipidaemia (37.0%), hypertension (36.0%), knee or hip osteoarthritis (15.9%), obstructive sleep apnoea (11.7%), asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (11.6%), liver disease (non- alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)) (8.6%) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (6.6%). Weight loss with Wegovy occurred early and continued throughout the trial. At end of treatment (week 68), the weight loss with Wegovy was superior and clinically meaningful compared with placebo (see Table 5 and Figure 3). Furthermore, a higher proportion of patients achieved ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15% and ≥20% weight loss with Wegovy compared with placebo (see Table 5 and Figure 4). Among patients with pre-diabetes at baseline, 84.1% and 47.8% achieved a normo-glycaemic status at end of treatment with Wegovy and placebo, respectively. Following the 68-week trial, a 52-week off-treatment extension was conducted including 327 patients who had completed the main trial period on the maintenance dose of Wegovy or placebo. The trial extension consisted of four clinic visits and did not include structured lifestyle intervention. In the off-treatment period from week 68 to week 120, mean body weight increased in both treatment groups. However, for patients that had been treated with semaglutide for the main trial period the weight remained 5.6% below baseline compared to 0.1% for the placebo group.

STEP 2: Weight Management in patients with type 2 diabetes In a 68-week, double-blind and double-dummy trial, 1210 patients with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) and type 2 diabetes were randomised to either Wegovy, semaglutide 1 mg once-weekly or placebo. Patients included in the trial had insufficiently controlled diabetes (HbA1c 7–10%) and were treated with either diet and exercise alone or 1–3 oral anti-diabetic drugs. All patients received counselling with regards to diet (500 kcal/2092 kJ deficit per day) relative to the estimated total energy expenditure (TEE) (calculated once at randomisation), and physical activity (150 min of physical activity per week was encouraged). At baseline, patients had a mean BMI of 35.7 kg/m2, a mean body weight of 99.8 kg and a mean HbA1C of 8.1%. The mean age was 55 years. There were 62.1% Caucasian/White, 8.3% Black/African American, and 26.2% Asian. A total of 12.8% were Hispanic or Latino. The majority of patients had at least two weight-related comorbidities.

The first 8 weeks included a 1000-1200 kcal/day (4184-5020.8 kJ/day) low-calorie diet provided as meal replacements and portion-controlled meals. From week 8 and onwards, daily caloric targets were defined based on baseline body weight and ranged from 1200 to 1800 kcal/day (5020.8-7531.2 kJ/day). Physical activity was prescribed with a target of 100 minutes physical activity per week, progressing gradually by 25 minutes every 4 weeks and up to 200 minutes/week. At baseline, patients had a mean BMI of 38.0 kg/m2 and a mean body weight of 105.8 kg. The mean age was 46 years. There were 76.1% Caucasian/White, 19.0% Black/African American, and 1.8% Asian. A total of 19.8% were Hispanic or Latino. The majority of patients had at least one weight- related comorbidity.

All patients received counselling with regards to diet (500 kcal/2092 kJ deficit per day) relative to the estimated total energy expenditure (TEE) (calculated once at randomisation), and physical activity (150 min of physical activity per week was encouraged). From week 0 to week 20 (run-in), all patients received Wegovy. At week 20 (baseline), 803 patients who had reached the maintenance dose of Wegovy were randomised to continue Wegovy or switch to placebo for the remaining 48 weeks. At the beginning of the run-in period (week 0), patients had a mean BMI of 38.4 kg/m2, a mean body weight of 107.2 kg and a mean age of 46 years. At baseline (week 20), patients had a mean BMI of 34.4 kg/m2 and a mean body weight of 96.1 kg. There were 83.7% Caucasian/White, 13.0% Black/African American, and 2.4% Asian. A total of 7.8% were Hispanic or Latino. The majority of patients had at least one weight-related comorbidity. These included, but were not limited to, pre- diabetes (46.8%), hypertension (37.1%), dyslipidaemia (35.9%), knee or hip osteoarthritis (13.3%), obstructive sleep apnoea (11.7%), asthma/COPD (11.5%), liver disease (NAFLD and NASH) (7.3%) and PCOS (3.9%). Patients who had reached the maintenance dose of Wegovy (2.4 mg) at week 20 (baseline) and continued treatment with Wegovy for 48 weeks continued losing weight and had a superior and clinically meaningful reduction in body weight compared to those switched to placebo (see Table 8 and Figure 7). On the other hand, in patients switching to placebo at week 20 (baseline), body weight increased steadily from week 20 to week 68. However, the observed mean body weight was lower at week 68 than at start of the run-in period (week 0) (see Figure 7). Patients treated with Wegovy from week 0 (run-in) to week 68 (end of treatment) achieved a mean change in body weight of 17.4%, with weight loss ≥5% achieved by 87.8%, ≥10% achieved by 78.0%, ≥15% achieved by 62.2% and ≥20% achieved by 38.6% of these patients.

All patients were counselled on healthy nutrition and physical activity with the goal of obtaining weight loss. Wegovy® Product Information Page 23 of 42 Weeks Wegovy Placebo Multiple imputation (MI) At baseline, patients had a mean BMI of 38.5 kg/m2, a mean body weight of 106.0 kg. The mean age was 47 years. There were 93.1% Caucasian/White, 3.9% Black/African American, and 0.7% Asian. A total of 12.8% were Hispanic or Latino. The majority of patients had at least one weight-related comorbidity. These included, but were not limited to, hypertension (38.8%), dyslipidaemia (35.2%), obstructive sleep apnoea (16.8%) and knee osteoarthritis (15.1%). Treatment with Wegovy for 104 weeks resulted in a superior and clinically meaningful reduction in body weight compared to placebo (see Table 9 and Figure 8). Mean body weight decreased from baseline through to week 68 with Wegovy after which a plateau was reached. With placebo, mean body weight decreased less, and a plateau was reached after approximately 20 weeks of treatment. A higher proportion of patients achieved ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15% and ≥20% weight loss with Wegovy compared with placebo. Among patients with pre-diabetes at baseline, 80% and 37% achieved a normo-glycaemic status at end of treatment with Wegovy and placebo, respectively.

Wegovy once weekly and liraglutide 3 mg were open-label, but each active treatment group was double-blinded against placebo administered at the same dosing frequency. All patients were on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity throughout the trial. At baseline, patients had a mean BMI of 37.5 kg/m2, a mean body weight of 104.5 kg. The mean age was 49 years. There were 73.7% Caucasian/White, 18.9% Black/African American, and 3.8% Asian. A total of 11.5% were Hispanic or Latino. The majority of patients had at least one weight-related comorbidity. These included, but were not limited to, dyslipidaemia (47.6%), hypertension (42.0%), knee osteoarthritis (18.3%) and obstructive sleep apnoea (18.0%). Treatment with Wegovy once weekly for 68 weeks resulted in superior and clinically meaningful reduction in body weight compared to liraglutide. Mean body weight decreased from baseline through to week 68 with Wegovy, with liraglutide, mean body weight decreased less, and with placebo less yet. 37.4% of the patients treated with semaglutide lost ≥20%, compared to 7.0% treated with liraglutide.

In the phase 3a trials, the reduction in body weight was shown to occur irrespective of the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. Cardiovascular risk factors Wegovy reduced waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and CRP, and improved lipid profile compared with placebo. Lipids Wegovy improved total cholesterol by -0.9% to -5.9%, HDL-cholesterol by 0.3% to 3.8% LDL- cholesterol by 0.4% to -7.1%, and triglycerides by -17.8% to -15.8%, after 68 weeks of treatment. Blood Pressure Wegovy reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 3.4 mmHg to 5.1 mmHg and 0.7 mmHg to 2.4 mmHg respectively after 68 weeks of treatment. Waist circumference Wegovy reduced waist circumference by 4.9 cm to 9.4 cm after 68 weeks of treatment. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Wegovy reduced CRP (marker of systemic inflammation) by 38.7% to 47.6% after 68 weeks of treatment. Cardiovascular outcomes SELECT: Cardiovascular outcome trial in patients with overweight or obesity SELECT was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event driven trial which included 17,604 patients with established cardiovascular disease (67.6 % with prior myocardial infarction only, 17.8 % with prior stroke only and 4.4 % with peripheral arterial disease only; 8.2 % with 2 or more prior CV events) and BMI≥27 kg/m2. Patients with history of type 1 and type 2 diabetes were excluded. The median time in trial was 41.8 months. The study population consisted of 27.7 % female and 72.3 % male, with a mean age of 61.6 years, including 38.2 % patients ≥ 65 years (n = 6,728) and 7.8 % patients ≥ 75 years (n = 1,366). The mean BMI was 33.3 kg/m2 and mean body weight was 96.7 kg. Patients were randomised to either semaglutide 2.4 mg (n=8,803) or placebo (n=8,801) in addition to standard-of-care. At baseline, 92.0 % of patients were receiving cardiovascular medication (70.2 % beta blockers, 45.0 % Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 29.5 % angiotensin receptor Wegovy® Product Information Page 26 of 42 blockers and 26.9 % calcium-channel blockers), 90.1 % lipid lowering agents (primarily statins 87.6 %) and 86.2 % anti-platelet agents. At baseline most patients had cardiovascular related comorbidities including 66.5 % with HbA1c ≥ 5.7% indicative of prediabetes, 24.3 % with chronic heart failure, 81.8 % with hypertension, 46.8 % with inflammation (hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L) as well as patients with mild (48.7 %), moderate (10.4 %) or severe (0.4 %) renal impairment. For the primary MACE endpoint, the superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg to placebo was confirmed demonstrated with a hazard ratio 0.80 [0.72; 0.90] [95% CI], corresponding to a relative risk reduction in MACE of 20 % (see Figure 9). The primary MACE endpoint results showed statistical significance for one out of the three components, namely non-fatal MI, but not for CV death or non- fatal stroke (Figure 10). Each component contributed to the reduction of MACE (Figure 10). The cardiovascular risk reduction appeared largely independent of weight loss. The treatment effect was consistent across all subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, region, prior CV disease (MI, stroke, PAD, or any combination thereof), BMI, chronic heart failure status, HbA1c (<5.7% or ≥5.7%), and renal function (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 or ≥60mL/min/1.73m2).

Before analysis, missing data were multiple imputed. The imputation model (linear regression) was done separately for each treatment arm and included baseline value as a covariate and was fitted to all subjects with a measurement regardless of treatment status at week 104. The fitted model was used to impute values for subjects without a measurement at week 104. Mean estimates were adjusted according to observed baseline distribution. SUSTAIN 6: Cardiovascular outcome trial in patients with type 2 diabetes unrelated to weight loss In the SUSTAIN 6 trial for OZEMPIC (semaglutide) for a type 2 diabetes indication unrelated to weight loss, 3,297 patients with type 2 diabetes and at high risk of cardiovascular events were randomised to semaglutide s.c. 0.5 mg or 1 mg once-weekly or placebo in addition to standard-of- care. The treatment duration was 104 weeks. The mean age was 65 years and the mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. The primary endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE): cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The secondary endpoint was time from randomisation to first occurrence of an expanded composite cardiovascular outcome, defined as MACE, revascularisation (coronary and peripheral), unstable angina requiring hospitalisation or hospitalisation for heart failure. The total number of the primary component MACE endpoint was 254, including 108 (6.6%) with semaglutide and 146 (8.9%) with placebo. Wegovy® Product Information Page 29 of 42 Treatment with semaglutide reduced the rate of MACE vs placebo with a risk reduction of 26%, HR 0.74, [0.58, 0.95] [95% CI]. This was mainly driven by a significant (39%) decrease in the rate of non- fatal stroke and a non-significant (26%) decrease in non-fatal myocardial infarction with no difference in cardiovascular death (see Figure 11). Figure 11 Kaplan-Maier plot of time to first occurrence of the composite outcome: Cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (SUSTAIN 6) Semaglutide also significantly reduced the risk of a composite of coronary or peripheral revascularisation. See Figure 12 for results on primary and secondary cardiovascular endpoints. Figure 12 Forest plot: Analyses of each individual cardiovascular event types (SUSTAIN 6) Glycaemic control Treatment with Wegovy significantly improved glycaemic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes (Table 12). Wegovy improved glycaemic control through sustained reduction of HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels. Reduction in HbA1c was 1.2% and reduction in FPG was 2.0 mmol/L. In STEP 2, 78.5% of patients with type 2 diabetes treated with Wegovy achieved an HbA1c <7% compared to 26.5% with placebo. A total of 67.5% of the patients treated with Wegovy achieved an HbA1c ≤6.5% compared to 15.5% with placebo.

All patients were on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity throughout the trial. At baseline, patients had a mean BMI of 37.0 kg/m2 and a mean body weight of 107.5 kg. The mean age of patients was 15.4 years. There were 37.8% males, 79.1% Caucasian/White, 8.0% Black/African American and 2.0% Asian. A total of 10.9% were Hispanic or Latino. At end of treatment (week 68), the improvement in BMI with Wegovy was superior and clinically meaningful compared with placebo (see Table 13 and Figure 13). Furthermore, a higher proportion of patients achieved ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15% and ≥20% weight loss with Wegovy compared with placebo (see Table 13). Also, improvement in weight category was seen for a larger proportion of patients with Wegovy (71.8%) compared to placebo (21.0%). Improvement was defined as changing from a higher to a lower obesity class, or to overweight or normal weight. At end of treatment, a higher proportion of patients with Wegovy (53.7%) changed at least 2 categories compared to placebo (3.8%). Wegovy® Product Information Page 31 of 42 Greater reductions in absolute BMI, BMI standard deviation score (SDS), BMI percentage of the 95th percentile (sex- and age-specific growth charts) and body weight were observed with Wegovy compared to placebo at week 68.

Improvement in physical functioning score with Wegovy compared to placebo was also observed in STEP 3; however, not statistically significant (Table 14). Physical functioning was assessed using both the Short Form-36v2 Health Survey, Acute Version (SF-36v2) and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Lite Clinical Trials Version (IWQOL-Lite-CT). Beneficial effects of Wegovy vs placebo were demonstrated in STEP 1 and 2 in all additional scores on SF-36v2 (Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, Mental Health, Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary), except for Role-Emotional in STEP 2. Beneficial effects of Wegovy vs. placebo were also demonstrated in STEP 1 and 2 in all additional scores on IWQOL-Lite-CT (Physical, Psychosocial, and Total). In STEP 3, beneficial effects of Wegovy vs. placebo were demonstrated for the following scores in SF-36: General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional and Mental Component Summary.

The principal mechanism of protraction is albumin binding, which results in decreased renal clearance and protection from metabolic degradation. Furthermore, semaglutide is stabilised against degradation by the DPP-4 enzyme. Absorption The average semaglutide steady state concentration following s.c. administration of Wegovy was approximately 75 nmol/L in patients with either overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) or obesity Wegovy® Product Information Page 35 of 42 (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). The steady state exposure of semaglutide increased proportionally with doses up to 2.4 mg once weekly. Similar exposure was achieved with s.c. administration of semaglutide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. The absolute bioavailability of semaglutide was 89% Distribution The mean volume of distribution of semaglutide following s.c. administration in patients with overweight or obesity is approximately 12.4 L. Semaglutide is extensively bound to plasma albumin (> 99%). Metabolism Semaglutide is metabolised through proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential beta-oxidation of the fatty acid side chain. Excretion Semaglutide has pharmacokinetic properties compatible with once-weekly administration, with an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week. The primary excretion routes of semaglutide-related material are via the urine and faeces. Approximately 3% of the dose was excreted in the urine as intact semaglutide. Clearance of semaglutide in patient with overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) or obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) was approximately 0.05 L/h. With an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week, semaglutide can be present in the circulation for approximately 7 weeks after the last dose of 2.4 mg. Special populations Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, sex, race, and ethnicity, and renal impairment do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. The exposure of semaglutide decreases with an increase in body weight. However, semaglutide 2.4 mg provide adequate systemic exposure over the body weight range of 54.4-245.6 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. The effects of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide are shown in Figure 14. Wegovy® Product Information Page 36 of 42 Figure 14 Impact of intrinsic factors on semaglutide exposure Data are steady-state dose-normalised average semaglutide exposures relative to a reference subject profile (non-Hispanic or Latino, normoglycaemic (STEP 1) white female aged 18-<65 years, with a body weight of 110 kg and normal renal function, who injected in the"}

Body weight test categories (74 and 143 kg) represent the 5% and 95% percentiles in the data set. Age Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide based on data from phase 3 trials including patients 18−86 years of age. Sex Gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. Race Race (White, Black or African-American, Asian) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. Ethnicity Ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. Body weight Body weight had an effect on the exposure of semaglutide. Higher body weight was associated with lower exposure. The 2.4 mg weekly dose of semaglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 54.4-245.6 kg evaluated for exposure response in the clinical trials. Renal impairment Renal impairment did not impact the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide in a clinically relevant manner. This was shown with a single dose of 0.5 mg semaglutide for patients with different degrees of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe or subjects in dialysis) compared with subjects with normal renal function. This was also shown for subjects with overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) or obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and mild to moderate renal impairment based on data from phase 3a trials.

The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide were evaluated in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, severe) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function in a study with a single- dose of 0.5 mg semaglutide. Paediatrics Semaglutide has not been studied in children below 12 years of age. Pharmacokinetic properties for semaglutide 2.4 mg were assessed in a clinical trial for adolescent patients with obesity or overweight and at least one weight-related comorbidity ages 12 to less than 18 years (124 patients, body weight 61.6-211.9 kg). The semaglutide exposure in adolescents was similar to that in adults with obesity or overweight. 5.3 PRECLINICAL SAFETY DATA Genotoxicity Semaglutide was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, and was not clastogenic in vitro (cytogenetic assay in human lymphocytes), or in vivo (rat bone marrow micronucleus test). Carcinogenicity Non-lethal thyroid C-cell tumours observed in rodents are a class effect for GLP-1 receptor agonists. In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, semaglutide caused thyroid C-cell tumours at clinically relevant exposures (at ≥ 1.2× the clinical AUC in mice [based on the plasma AUC at the maximum recommended human dose of 2.4 mg/week] and subclinical exposures in rats; a no effect level was not established in either species). No other treatment-related tumours were observed. The rodent C-cell tumors are caused by a non-genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. The relevance for humans is considered to be low, but cannot be excluded. Juvenile toxicity In juvenile rats, semaglutide caused delayed sexual maturation in both males and females. These delays had no impact upon fertility and reproductive capacity of either sex, or on the ability of the females to maintain pregnancy. 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 LIST OF EXCIPIENTS Single-dose pen Dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate Sodium chloride Hydrochloric acid Sodium hydroxide Water for injections FlexTouch pen Dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate Propylene glycol Phenol Hydrochloric acid Sodium hydroxide Water for injections Wegovy® Product Information Page 38 of 42 6.2 INCOMPATIBILITIES Substances added to Wegovy may cause degradation of semaglutide.

ZOLOFT® 1 ZOLOFT® Active ingredient: sertraline hydrochloride Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) This leaflet provides important information about using ZOLOFT. You should also speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you would like further information or if you have any concerns or questions about using ZOLOFT. Where to find information in this leaflet: 1. Why am I using ZOLOFT? 2. What should I know before I use ZOLOFT? 3. What if I am taking other medicines? 4. 5. What should I know while using ZOLOFT? 6. 7. Are there any side effects? Product details How do I use ZOLOFT? 1. Why am I using ZOLOFT? ZOLOFT contains the active ingredient sertraline hydrochloride. ZOLOFT belongs to a group of medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). They are thought to work by blocking the uptake of a chemical called serotonin into nerve cells in the brain. Serotonin and other chemicals called amines are involved in controlling mood. ZOLOFT is used to treat depression and conditions called obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, social phobia (social anxiety disorder) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). PMDD affects some women in the days before their period. PMDD is different from premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The mood symptoms (anger, sadness, tension, etc) in PMDD are more severe than in PMS and affect the woman's daily activities and relationships with others. ZOLOFT should not be used in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years for the treatment of any medical condition other than obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The safety and efficacy of ZOLOFT for the treatment of medical conditions (other than OCD) in this age group has not been satisfactorily established. For the treatment of OCD, ZOLOFT is not recommended for use in children under the age of 6, as the safety and efficacy in children of this age group has not been established. There is no evidence that ZOLOFT is addictive. 2. What should I know before I use ZOLOFT? Warnings Do not use ZOLOFT if: • • • • • • • • • Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include: o shortness of breath o wheezing or difficulty breathing o swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body o rash, itching or hives on the skin.

Taking ZOLOFT with a MAOI (e.g. Aurorix, Eldepryl, Nardil, Parnate) may cause a serious reaction with a sudden increase in body temperature, extremely high blood pressure and convulsions (fits). you are taking phentermine (used to help weight loss), tryptophan (contained in protein-based foods or dietary proteins), methadone (used to treat drug addiction), medicines used to treat migraine, e.g. sumatriptan (Imigran), dextromethorphan (used as a cough suppressant in cold and 'flu medications), medicines used for pain management such as fentanyl, tapentadol (Palexia), tramadol or pethidine. These medicines can cause an exaggerated response to ZOLOFT. you are taking pimozide (used to treat disturbances in thinking, feeling and behaviour). Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if you have been taking one of these medicines. Do not give ZOLOFT to children or adolescents under the age of 18 unless the doctor has prescribed it for the treatment of OCD. Do not give ZOLOFT to children under the age of 6 for the treatment of OCD. If you are not sure whether you should be taking ZOLOFT, talk to your doctor.

It is important you understand these risks and how to monitor for them. See additional information under Section 6. Are there any side effects? Pregnancy and breastfeeding Check with your doctor if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. There have been reports that babies exposed to ZOLOFT and other antidepressants during the third trimester of pregnancy may develop complications immediately after birth, e.g. you may experience heavy vaginal bleeding shortly after birth (postpartum haemorrhage). Talk to your doctor if you are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. ZOLOFT passes into breast milk and may affect your baby. Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of taking ZOLOFT when pregnant or breastfeeding. 3. What if I am taking other medicines? Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including all medicines, vitamins, natural therapies or supplements that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.

What should I know while using ZOLOFT? Things you must do Tell all doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking ZOLOFT. Tell your doctor or pharmacist that you are taking ZOLOFT if you are about to be started on any new medicines. Tell your doctor if you become pregnant while taking ZOLOFT. If you are a woman of child-bearing age, you should avoid becoming pregnant while taking ZOLOFT. If you are going to have surgery, tell the surgeon or anaesthetist that you are taking this medicine. It may interact with other medicines used during surgery and cause unwanted side effects. If you are about to have any urine tests, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine. It may interfere with the results of some tests. Call your doctor straight away if you: • have any suicidal thoughts or other mental/mood changes. A worsening of depressive symptoms including thoughts of suicide or self-harm may occur in the first one or two months of you taking ZOLOFT or when the doctor changes your dose. These symptoms should subside when the full effect of ZOLOFT takes place. Children, adolescents or young adults under 24 years of age are more likely to experience these effects during the first few months of treatment. Patients and caregivers should be alert and monitor for these effects. • • • Suddenly stopping ZOLOFT may cause dizziness, light headedness, numbness, unusual tingling feelings or shakiness. Do not give this medicine to anyone else, even if their symptoms seem similar to yours. Do not take ZOLOFT to treat any other complaints unless your doctor says to. Driving or using machines Be careful before you drive or use any machines or tools until you know how ZOLOFT affects you. Some medicines for depression may affect your ability to drive or operate machinery or do things that could be dangerous if you are not alert. If you are feeling drowsy or are uncoordinated, be careful that you do not fall over. ZOLOFT, like other medicines in this class, may increase your risk of bone fracture. Drinking alcohol Tell your doctor if you drink alcohol. Although drinking moderate amounts of alcohol is unlikely to affect your response to ZOLOFT, your doctor may suggest avoiding alcohol while you are taking ZOLOFT.

A locked cupboard at least 1and a half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines. Getting rid of any unwanted medicine If your doctor tells you to stop taking ZOLOFT, you no longer need to use this medicine or it is out of date, take it to any pharmacy for safe disposal. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date. 6. Are there any side effects? All medicines can have side effects. If you do experience any side effects, most of them are minor and temporary. However, some side effects may need medical attention. It can be difficult to tell whether side effects are the result of taking ZOLOFT, effects of your condition or side effects of other medicines you may be taking. For this reason it is important to tell your doctor of any change in your condition. Do not be alarmed by the list of side effects. You may not experience any of them.

Adults ZOLOFT (sertraline hydrochloride) is indicated for the treatment of major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic disorder. ZOLOFT (sertraline hydrochloride) is indicated for the treatment of social phobia (social anxiety disorder) and the prevention of its relapse. ZOLOFT (sertraline hydrochloride) is indicated for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) as defined by DSM-IV criteria. 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION Dosage Children and adolescents (6-18 years) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder The administration of ZOLOFT in children with OCD (ages 6-12 years) is recommended to commence at 25 mg/day (half a 50 mg tablet) for the first week and then increasing to 50 mg/day. Adolescents (ages 13-18 years) may commence at 50 mg/day. Clinical effects may be noted after 2 weeks of treatment but clinical responses should be monitored for 6 weeks before any increase in dose. In children, a dose of 200 mg/day should not be exceeded. Sertraline has an elimination half-life of approximately 26 hours; a once daily dose in the morning is recommended. ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION Adults (18 years and older) Major Depression/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder 2 Initial Treatment – ZOLOFT (sertraline hydrochloride) treatment should be initiated with a dose of 50 mg once daily. The usual therapeutic dose for depression and OCD is 50 mg/day. While a relationship between dose and antidepressant and anti-obsessive effect has not been established, patients were dosed in a range of 50-200 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the antidepressive and anti-obsessive effectiveness of ZOLOFT. Consequently, patients not responding to a 50 mg/day dose may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 200 mg/day. Given the 24-hour elimination half-life of ZOLOFT, dose changes should not occur at intervals of less than 1 week. The onset of therapeutic effect may be seen within 7 days; however, for full activity 2 to 4 weeks are usually necessary for depression, and possibly even longer for OCD. Following initial response, sertraline has been associated with sustained efficacy, safety and tolerability in up to 2 years of treatment of OCD. If no effect is apparent after six to eight weeks, discontinuation of treatment should be considered. Studies of efficacy did not examine the role of psychotherapy. Panic Disorder Initial Treatment – Therapy for panic disorder should commence at 25 mg/day (half a 50 mg tablet), increasing to 50 mg/day after one week. This dosage regimen has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of early treatment-emergent side effects commonly experienced on initiation of treatment of panic disorder. The long- term efficacy of ZOLOFT in panic disorder has not been established. Social Phobia (Social Anxiety Disorder) Initial treatment – Therapy for social phobia (social anxiety disorder) should commence at 25 mg/day (half a 50 mg tablet), increasing to 50 mg/day after one week. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder ZOLOFT treatment should be initiated with a dose of 50 mg/day either continuously (every day of the menstrual cycle) or intermittently (by starting 14 days prior to the anticipated onset of menstruation through to the first full day of menses and repeating with each cycle), depending on physician assessment. Patients not responding to a 50 mg/day dose may benefit from dose increases (at 50 mg increments/menstrual cycle) up to 150 mg/day when dosing daily throughout the menstrual cycle, or 100 mg/day when dosing during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. If a 100 mg/day dose has been established with luteal phase dosing, a 50 mg/day titration step for three days should be utilised at the beginning of each luteal phase dosing period. Dosage adjustments, which may include changes between dosage regimens (e.g., daily throughout the menstrual cycle versus during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle), may be needed to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment. Maintenance/Continuation/Extended Treatment There is evidence to suggest that depressed patients responding during an initial 8-week treatment phase will continue to benefit during an additional 16 weeks of treatment. While there are insufficient data regarding benefits from treatment beyond 24 weeks, it is generally agreed among expert psychopharmacologists that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy. Whether the dose of antidepressant needed to induce remission is identical to the dose needed to maintain and/or sustain euthymia is unknown. Discontinuation should be accomplished by a gradual reduction in dosage. ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 3 General The daily dose for all indications may be increased in 50 mg increments over a period of weeks. However, dose titrations in 50 mg increments will depend on tolerability and clinical response. The interval between dose increments should be at least one week. The maximum recommended dose of sertraline is 200 mg/day. The onset of therapeutic effect may be seen after a week, however, most responders can be expected to show a good response within 2-4 weeks. During prolonged maintenance therapy for any indication, dosage should be kept at the lowest effective level. ZOLOFT should be administered once daily, either in the morning or evening. ZOLOFT may be administered with or without food. As indicated under Section 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE, particular care should be taken in patients with hepatic impairment. Method of Administration Oral administration. 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS ZOLOFT is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to sertraline. Concomitant use in patients taking pimozide is contraindicated (see Section 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Cases of serious reactions, sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients receiving ZOLOFT in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), including the selective MAOI selegiline, the reversible MAOI (reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase – RIMA), moclobemide, and MAOI drugs, e.g., linezolid (an antibiotic that is a reversible non-selective MAOI) and methylene blue. Some cases presented with features resembling the serotonin syndrome. Similar cases, sometimes fatal, including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include confusion, irritability and extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma have been reported with other antidepressants during combined treatment with a MAOI and in patients who have recently discontinued an antidepressant or an anti-obsessional drug and have been started on a MAOI. ZOLOFT should not be used in combination with a MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping ZOLOFT before starting a MAOI. 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome The development of potentially life-threatening syndromes like serotonin syndrome (SS) or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including treatment with sertraline. The risk of SS or NMS with SSRIs is increased with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including amphetamines, triptans and opioids (e.g., fentanyl and its analogues, tramadol, dextromethorphan, tapentadol, pethidine, methadone, pentazocine), with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), antipsychotics and other dopamine antagonists. SS symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). Some signs of SS, including hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes resemble NMS. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of SS or NMS syndrome (see Section 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS). ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION Other Serotonergic Drugs 4 Coadministration of SSRIs such as sertraline with other drugs that enhance the effects of serotonergic neurotransmission, such as amphetamines, tryptophan, phentermine, fentanyl and its analogues, tramadol, 5- HT agonists, dextromethorphan, tapentadol, pethidine or methadone should be undertaken only with caution and avoided whenever possible due to the potential for pharmacodynamic interaction. St John’s Wort Concomitant use of the herbal remedy St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) in patients receiving SSRIs should be avoided since there is a possibility of serotonergic potentiation. Switching from Other Antidepressants or Anti-obsessional Drugs There is limited controlled experience regarding the optimal timing of switching from other antidepressants or anti-obsessional drugs to ZOLOFT. Care and prudent medical judgement should be exercised when switching, particularly from long-acting agents. The duration of a washout period for switching from one SSRI to another has not been established. QTc Prolongation/Torsade de Pointes (TdP) Cases of QTc prolongation and TdP have been reported during post-marketing use of sertraline. The majority of reports occurred in patients with other risk factors for QTc prolongation/TdP. Therefore, sertraline should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QTc prolongation (see Sections 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES, Clinical trials). INTERACTIONS and Activation of Mania/Hypomania During pre-marketing testing, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 0.4% of ZOLOFT treated patients. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder treated with other antidepressant and anti-obsessional drugs. Hyperkinesia has been noted in paediatric patients treated with sertraline for OCD, with an incidence of 8/53 (15.1%) for sertraline versus 3/54 (5.6%) for placebo in 6 to 12-year-olds, and 0/39 (0%) for sertraline versus 1/41 (2.4%) for placebo in 13- to 17-year-olds. Weight Loss Significant weight loss may be an undesirable result of treatment with sertraline for some patients but, on average, patients in controlled trials had minimal 0.5 to 1 kg weight loss, versus smaller changes on placebo. Only rarely (< 0.1%) have sertraline patients been discontinued for weight loss. In paediatric patients, weight loss was seen in 2/53 (3.8%) versus 0/54 (0%) of 6- to 12-year-old patients and 3/39 (7.7%) versus 0/41 (0%) of 13- to 17-year-olds treated with sertraline versus placebo. It is recommended that paediatric patients receiving long-term treatment should be monitored for weight and growth, consistent with good medical care. Seizures Seizures are a potential risk with antidepressant and anti-obsessional drugs. Seizures were reported in three out of 4000 patients (0.08%)"}

It is recommended that paediatric patients receiving long-term treatment should be monitored for weight and growth, consistent with good medical care. Seizures Seizures are a potential risk with antidepressant and anti-obsessional drugs. Seizures were reported in three out of 4000 patients (0.08%) treated with ZOLOFT in the development programme for depression. No seizures were reported in patients treated with sertraline in the development programme for panic. During the development programme for OCD, four out of 1801 patients (0.2%) exposed to ZOLOFT experienced seizures. In the paediatric OCD trial programme, the incidence of seizures in the adolescent (13 to 17 years old) population was 3/163 (1.8%) on sertraline compared with 0/41 (0%) on placebo. Seizures/convulsions were not noted in 6- to 12-year-old patients. In all these cases, the relationship with sertraline therapy was uncertain. Since ZOLOFT has not been evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder it should be avoided in patients with unstable epilepsy; patients with controlled epilepsy should be carefully monitored. ZOLOFT should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures. ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk 5 The risk of suicide attempt is inherent in depression and may persist until significant remission occurs. This risk of suicide must be considered in all depressed patients. Because of the coexistence of depression in patients with other psychiatric disorders, such as OCD, panic disorder, social phobia (social anxiety disorder) and PMDD, the same precautions should be observed when treating patients with these disorders as when treating patients with depression. Patients with depression may experience worsening of their depressive symptoms and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behaviours (suicidality), whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. As improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored for clinical worsening and suicidality, especially at the beginning of a course of treatment, or at the time of dose changes, either increases or decreases. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse or whose emergent suicidality is severe, abrupt in onset, or was not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be alerted about the need to monitor for any worsening of their condition and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation/behaviour or thoughts of harming themselves and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present. Patients with co-morbid depression associated with other psychiatric disorders being treated with antidepressants should be similarly observed for clinical worsening and suicidality. Pooled analyses of 24 short-term (4 to 16 weeks), placebo-controlled trials of nine antidepressant medicines (SSRIs and others) in 4400 children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (16 trials), obsessive compulsive disorder (4 trials), or other psychiatric disorders (4 trials) have revealed a greater risk of adverse events representing suicidal behaviour or thinking (suicidality) during the initial treatment period (generally the first one to two months) in those receiving antidepressants. The average risk of such events in patients treated with an antidepressant was 4% compared with 2% of patients treated with placebo. There was considerable variation in risk among the antidepressants, but there was a tendency towards an increase for almost all antidepressants studied. The risk of suicidality was most consistently observed in the major depressive disorder trials, but there were signals of risk arising from trials in other psychiatric indications (obsessive compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder) as well. No suicides occurred in these trials. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk in children and adolescent patients extends to use beyond several months. The nine antidepressant medicines in the pooled analyses included five SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) and four non-SSRIs (bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, venlafaxine). A further pooled analysis of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant medicines (SSRIs and others) showed the increased risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour (suicidality) during the initial treatment period (generally the first one to two months) extends to young adults (aged 18 to 24 years) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. These studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Symptoms of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility (aggressiveness), impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adults, adolescents and children being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either worsening of depression and/or emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may be precursors of emerging suicidality. Families and caregivers of children and adolescents being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or for any other condition (psychiatric or non-psychiatric), should be informed about the need to monitor these patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behaviour, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 6 to health care providers. It is particularly important that monitoring be undertaken during the initial few months of antidepressant treatment or at times of dose increase or decrease. Prescriptions for ZOLOFT should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Weak Uricosuric Effect ZOLOFT is associated with a mean decrease in serum uric acid of approximately 7%. The clinical significance of this weak uricosuric effect is unknown, and there have been no reports of acute renal failure with ZOLOFT. Sexual Dysfunction SSRIs may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (see Section 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS)). There have been reports of long-lasting sexual dysfunction where the symptoms have continued despite discontinuation of SSRIs. Abnormal Bleeding/Haemorrhage Bleeding abnormalities have been reported with the use of SSRIs (including purpura, haematoma, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding, ecchymoses, gastrointestinal bleeding and life-threatening haemorrhage). This risk may be potentiated by concurrent use of atypical antipsychotics and phenothiazines, most tricyclic antidepressants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin or other medicines that affect coagulation. ZOLOFT should therefore be used with caution in patients concomitantly treated with medicines that increase the risk of bleeding or in patients with a past history of abnormal bleeding or those with predisposing conditions. Pharmacological gastroprotection should be considered for high risk patients. Postpartum haemorrhage SSRI/SNRIs may increase the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (see Section 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION and 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS)). Hyponatraemia Hyponatraemia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs or serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) including sertraline. In many cases, hyponatraemia appears to be the result of a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases of serum sodium levels lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatraemia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume-depleted may be at greater risk (see Section 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE, Use in the Elderly). Discontinuation of sertraline should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatraemia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatraemia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness and unsteadiness that may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest and death. Bone Fractures Epidemiological studies show an increased risk of bone fractures in patients receiving serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) including sertraline. The mechanism leading to this risk is not fully understood. Diabetes/Loss of Glycaemic Control Cases of new-onset diabetes mellitus have been reported in patients receiving SSRIs including ZOLOFT. Loss of glycaemic control including both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia has also been reported in patients with and without pre-existing diabetes. Patients should therefore be monitored for signs and symptoms of glucose fluctuations. Diabetic patients especially should have their glycaemic control carefully monitored since their dosage of insulin and/or concomitant oral hypoglycaemic drug may need to be adjusted. ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION Angle-Closure Glaucoma 7 SSRIs including sertraline may have an effect on pupil size resulting in mydriasis. This mydriatic effect has the potential to narrow the eye angle, resulting in increased intraocular pressure and angle-closure glaucoma, especially in patients pre-disposed. Sertraline should therefore be used with caution in patients with angle- closure glaucoma or history of glaucoma. Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Caution is advisable in using ZOLOFT in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or haemodynamic responses. ZOLOFT has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarket testing. However, the electrocardiograms (ECG) of 774 patients who received ZOLOFT in double-blind trials were evaluated and the data indicate that ZOLOFT is not associated with the development of significant ECG abnormalities. Symptoms Associated with Discontinuation During marketing of ZOLOFT and other SSRIs and SNRIs (Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors) there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paraesthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, some have been reported to be severe. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with ZOLOFT. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered."}

A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see Sections 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS), 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION, and 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION). Drug Abuse and Dependence In human studies, sertraline has not demonstrated potential for abuse. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised study of comparative abuse liability of sertraline, alprazolam and d-amphetamine in humans, sertraline did not produce positive subjective effects indicative of abuse potential, such as euphoria or drug liking. As with any CNS active drug, however, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of ZOLOFT misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behaviour). Electroconvulsive Therapy There are no clinical studies establishing the risks or benefits of the combined use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and ZOLOFT. Use in Hepatic Impairment Sertraline is extensively metabolised by the liver. A multiple dose pharmacokinetic study in subjects with mild, stable cirrhosis administered sertraline 50 mg/day for 21 days demonstrated a prolonged elimination half-life and approximately a three-fold greater AUC and Cmax for sertraline and a two-fold greater AUC and Cmax for the metabolite in comparison to normal subjects. There were no significant differences in plasma protein binding observed between the two groups. The use of sertraline in patients with hepatic disease should be approached with caution. Patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. A lower or less frequent dose should be used in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in Renal Impairment Sertraline is extensively metabolised. Excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. In a study of patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 mL/min to 60 mL/min) ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 8 or moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 mL/min to 29 mL/min) administered sertraline 50 mg/day for 21 days multiple dose pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-24 or Cmax) were not statistically significantly different compared to controls. Half-lives were similar and there were no differences in plasma protein binding of all the groups studied. This study indicates that, as expected from the low renal excretion of sertraline, ZOLOFT dosing does not have to be adjusted based on degree of renal impairment. Use in the Elderly Several hundred elderly patients have participated in clinical studies with ZOLOFT. The pattern of adverse reactions in the elderly was similar to that in younger patients. Paediatric Use A total of 225 paediatric patients have completed OCD trials with sertraline. The safety profile of ZOLOFT in these paediatric studies is comparable to that observed in the adult OCD studies. Long-term safety on cognitive, emotional, physical, and pubertal maturation in children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years was evaluated in a long-term observational study for up to 3 years (see Section 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES). Physicians must monitor paediatric patients on long-term treatment for abnormalities in growth and development. Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established. Sertraline should not be used in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The efficacy and safety of sertraline has not been satisfactorily established for the treatment of major depressive disorder in this age group. Effects on Laboratory Tests False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking sertraline. This is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of sertraline therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish sertraline from benzodiazepines. 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors See Section 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS. Pimozide Increased pimozide levels have been demonstrated in a study of single low-dose pimozide (2 mg) with sertraline coadministration. Coadministration of pimozide and sertraline increased pimozide Cmax and AUC by 35% and 37%, respectively. These increased levels did not significantly increase the QTc interval. While the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide, concomitant administration of sertraline and pimozide is contraindicated. There are no data with pimozide at doses greater than 2 mg (see Section 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS). Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval The risk of QTc prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., TdP) is increased with concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval (e.g., some antipsychotics and antibiotics) (see Sections 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE, QTc Prolongation/Torsade de Pointes and 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES, Clinical trials). ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION CNS Depressants and Alcohol 9 Although ZOLOFT did not potentiate the cognitive and psychomotor effects of alcohol in experiments with normal subjects, the concomitant use of ZOLOFT and alcohol in depressed patients is not recommended. Coadministration of Drugs with Serotonergic Action Sumatriptan There have been rare post-marketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, incoordination, confusion, anxiety and agitation following the use of sertraline and sumatriptan. If concomitant treatment with sertraline and sumatriptan is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised (see Section 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE). Other Serotonergic Drugs See Sections 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS, Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE, Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome and Other Serotonergic Drugs. St John’s Wort See Section 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE. Medicines that Interfere with Haemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin, etc) Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in haemostasis. There is an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of abnormal bleeding. Concurrent use of an NSAID, aspirin or warfarin potentiates the risk. Thus, patients should be cautioned about using such medicines concurrently with ZOLOFT. Potential Effects of Coadministration of Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Proteins Because sertraline is tightly bound to plasma protein, the administration of ZOLOFT to a patient taking another drug which is bound to protein may cause a shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse effect. Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein-bound sertraline by other protein- bound drugs. However, in three formal interaction studies with diazepam, tolbutamide and warfarin respectively, sertraline was not shown to have any significant effects on the protein binding of the substrate (see Section 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS, Warfarin). Warfarin Coadministration of sertraline 200 mg daily with warfarin resulted in an 8% delay in normalisation of prothrombin time compared to placebo (p < 0.02). The clinical significance of this is unknown. Accordingly, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored when ZOLOFT therapy is initiated or stopped. Lithium In placebo-controlled trials in normal volunteers, the coadministration of sertraline with lithium did not significantly alter the lithium pharmacokinetics, but did result in an increase in tremor relative to placebo, indicating a possible pharmacodynamic interaction. Coadministering sertraline with medications, such as lithium, which may act via serotonergic mechanisms, should be undertaken with caution in patients and appropriately monitored. Phenytoin A placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers given sertraline 200 mg and phenytoin 100 mg for 10 days did not produce statistically significant differences in phenytoin pharmacokinetic parameters between the sertraline and placebo groups. Nonetheless, it is recommended that plasma phenytoin concentrations be ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 10 monitored following initiation of sertraline therapy, with appropriate adjustments to the phenytoin dose. In addition, coadministration of phenytoin may cause a reduction of sertraline plasma levels. Drugs Metabolised by Cytochrome P450 2D6 There is variability among antidepressants in the extent to which they inhibit the activity of isozyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6, and in fact sertraline at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class. Nevertheless, even sertraline has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition. The clinical significance of this depends on the extent of inhibition and the therapeutic index of the coadministered drug. Consequently, concomitant use of a drug metabolised by CYP 2D6 with ZOLOFT may require lower doses than usually prescribed for the other drug. Furthermore, whenever ZOLOFT is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of the coadministered drug may be required. CYP 2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), class 1C antiarrhythmics such as propafenone and flecainide, and methadone. In formal interaction studies, sertraline 50 mg daily produced increases (p < 0.001) in desipramine Cmax (44%) and AUC (mean 23% to 37%). Drugs Metabolised by Other CYP Enzymes (CYP 3A3/4, CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19, CYP 1A2) CYP 3A3/4 In vivo interaction studies have demonstrated that administration of sertraline for 17-21 days at the high dose of 200 mg daily did not statistically significantly inhibit the CYP 3A3/4 metabolism of carbamazepine or terfenadine. In addition, the administration of sertraline 50 mg daily for 14 days did not statistically significantly inhibit the CYP 3A3/4-mediated metabolism of alprazolam. The results of these studies suggest that sertraline is not likely to be a clinically important inhibitor of CYP 3A3/4. Coadministration of sertraline with metamizole, which is an inducer of metabolising enzymes including CYP 2B6 and CYP 3A4 may cause a reduction in plasma concentrations of sertraline with potential decrease in clinical efficacy, therefore, caution is advised when metamizole and sertraline are administered concurrently; clinical response and/or drug levels should be monitored as appropriate. CYP 2C9 The apparent lack of clinically significant effects of the chronic administration of sertraline at the high dose of 200 mg daily on plasma concentrations of tolbutamide, phenytoin and warfarin suggests that sertraline is not a clinically important inhibitor of CYP 2C9 (see Sections 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF"}

CYP 2C9 The apparent lack of clinically significant effects of the chronic administration of sertraline at the high dose of 200 mg daily on plasma concentrations of tolbutamide, phenytoin and warfarin suggests that sertraline is not a clinically important inhibitor of CYP 2C9 (see Sections 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS, Phenytoin and Warfarin). CYP 2C19 The apparent lack of clinically significant effects of the chronic administration of sertraline at the high dose of 200 mg daily on plasma concentrations of diazepam suggests that sertraline is not a clinically important inhibitor of CYP 2C19 (see Section 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS, Other Drug Interactions). CYP 1A2 An in vitro study indicates that sertraline is a weak inhibitor of CYP 1A2. Other Drug Interactions Formal drug interaction studies have been performed with sertraline. Changes in drug levels as a result of interactions have been demonstrated. The precise clinical significance of these changes is unknown. Cimetidine Coadministration of cimetidine caused a statistically significant increase in sertraline mean AUC by 50% and Cmax by 24% and T1/2 by 26%. ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 11 Atenolol/Digoxin Sertraline had no effect on the beta-adrenergic blocking activity of atenolol. No interaction was observed with digoxin. Diazepam Coadministration of diazepam showed a statistically significant decrease in diazepam clearance of 32% from baseline compared to a 19% decrease with placebo. Tmax for desmethyldiazepam was also statistically significantly prolonged by 23% in the sertraline group versus a decrease in the placebo group. Glibenclamide No interaction was observed with glibenclamide. Clozapine As in the coadministration with other SSRIs, isolated cases of increased clozapine levels have been reported. Microsomal Enzyme Induction Preclinical studies have shown ZOLOFT to induce hepatic microsomal enzymes. In clinical studies, ZOLOFT was shown to induce hepatic enzymes minimally as determined by a small (5%) but statistically significant decrease in antipyrine half-life following administration of 200 mg/day for 21 days. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on Fertility A decrease in fertility was seen in one of two rat studies at a dose of 80 mg/kg (giving rise to plasma drug exposure levels similar to or slightly higher than that achieved following the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mg). Use in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C This category is defined as drugs which, owing to their pharmacological effects, have caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible. Neonates exposed to ZOLOFT, other SSRIs, or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalisation, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycaemia, hypotonia, apnoea, seizures, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. temperature Teratogenic Effects Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 80 and 40 mg/kg, respectively, giving rise to plasma drug exposure levels similar to or slightly higher than that achieved following the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mg. There was no evidence of teratogenicity at any dose level. However, sertraline was associated with delayed ossification in fetuses, probably secondary to effects on the dams. Non-teratogenic Effects Observational studies have provided evidence of an increased risk (less than 2-fold) of postpartum haemorrhage following exposure to SSRIs, including sertraline, especially within the month prior to birth. ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 12 There was also decreased neonatal survival following maternal administration of sertraline at doses giving rise to plasma drug exposure levels similar to or slightly higher than that achieved following the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mg. The decrease in pup survival was shown to be most probably due to in-utero exposure to sertraline. The clinical significance of these effects is unknown. Similar effects have been described with other antidepressants. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, ZOLOFT should not be used during pregnancy unless in the judgement of the physician, the expected benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The use of SSRIs in the third trimester may result in a withdrawal state in the newborn infant. Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant if taking ZOLOFT. Exposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. A study of 831,324 infants born in Sweden in 1997 to 2005 found a PPHN risk ratio of 2.4 (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.3) associated with patient-reported maternal use of SSRIs “in early pregnancy” and a PPHN risk ratio of 3.6 (95% CI, 1.2 to 8.3) associated with a combination of patient-reported maternal use of SSRIs “in early pregnancy” and an antenatal SSRI prescription “in later pregnancy”. Labour and Delivery The effect of ZOLOFT on labour and delivery in humans is unknown. Use in Lactation Only limited data concerning sertraline levels in breast milk are available. However, in breast-fed infants whose mothers were taking sertraline, there have been reports of adverse effects. Because sertraline is excreted in human milk, breastfeeding while on ZOLOFT is not recommended. If ZOLOFT is used during lactation, the physician should be aware that withdrawal reactions have been reported in some neonates whose mothers had been on SSRI antidepressants, including ZOLOFT. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES In controlled studies, ZOLOFT did not cause sedation and did not interfere with psychomotor performance. However, as psychotropic drugs may impair the mental or physical attributes required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or using machinery the patient should be cautioned accordingly. 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Adverse events are listed within body system and categorised by frequency according to the following definitions: Very common: ≥ 10% Common: ≥ 1% and < 10% Uncommon: ≥ 0.1% and < 1% Rare: ≥ 0.01% and < 0.1% Unknown: Cannot be estimated from available data ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 13 Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial Data The following adverse events occurred at a frequency of 1% or more among ZOLOFT patients and at least twice the frequency seen in placebo patients, who participated in placebo-controlled clinical trials (adults - depression, OCD, children and adolescents - paediatric OCD). In these clinical trials most patients received doses of 50 to 200 mg/day. These events are not necessarily related to ZOLOFT treatment. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Common: Decreased appetite Psychiatric disorders: Very common: Insomnia Common: Agitation, anxiety, bruxism, libido decreased, nervousness, nightmare, thinking abnormal Nervous system disorders: Very common: Tremor, somnolence, dizziness Common: Convulsion (including myoclonus), hypoaesthesia, hyperkinesia, hypertonia, disturbance in attention Eye disorders: Common: Visual impairment Cardiac disorders: Common: Palpitations Vascular disorders: Common: Hot flush Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Common: Yawning Gastrointestinal disorders: Very common: Diarrhoea, nausea Common: Vomiting, dry mouth, dyspepsia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Common: Rash, hyperhidrosis, urticaria Renal and urinary disorders: Common: Urinary retention Reproductive system and breast disorders: Common: Ejaculation disorder, sexual dysfunction (see Section 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE), vaginal haemorrhage, menstruation irregular General disorders and administration site conditions: Very common: Fatigue Common: Malaise, pyrexia ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 14 Investigations: Common: Weight increased, weight decreased Other adverse events reported (incidence > 10%) and not meeting the above criteria were dry mouth, dizziness, diarrhoea/loose stools, headache and abdominal pain (paediatric OCD patients only). In a 12-week placebo-controlled study in paediatric patients with OCD, adverse events of at least 5% incidence that were seen with a statistically significantly increased level for sertraline compared with placebo were headache, insomnia and agitation in 6-12 year olds. For 13-17 year olds, the comparable categories were insomnia, decreased appetite and tremor. Most of the effects seen were mild to moderate in severity. In these clinical trials, sexual dysfunction was not specifically reported. However, in common with all other SSRIs, sexual dysfunction in males and, to a lesser extent, females have been reported in adult studies. The side effect profile commonly observed in double-blind, placebo controlled studies in patients with panic disorder, social phobia (social anxiety disorder) and PMDD was similar to that observed in clinical trials patients with depression. Adverse Effects from Clinical Trials in Paediatric MDD In clinical trials in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with major depressive disorder the following adverse events were reported at a frequency of at least 2% of subjects and occurred at a rate of at least twice that of placebo: diarrhoea (9.5% vs 1.6%), agitation (6.3% vs 1.1%), decreased appetite (5.3% vs 1.1%), vomiting (4.2% vs 1.1%) hyperkinesia (2.6% vs 0.5%), dry mouth (2.1% vs 0.5%), tremor (2.1% vs 0%) and urinary incontinence (2.1% vs 0%). The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was 9% (n=17) with sertraline and 2.1 (n=4) with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse events, whether or not related to sertraline, were aggression (1.6%), agitation (1.6%), suicidal ideation (1.6%), hyperkinesia (1.1%), suicide attempt (1.1%) and aggravated depression (1.1%). In the safety analysis, suicide attempt was reported in the same number of patients in sertraline (2/189, 1.1%) and placebo (2/184, 1.1%) with an incidence of suicide attempts in sertraline-treated subjects of 1.1% (2 attempts in 2/189 subjects) versus 1.6% in placebo-treated subjects (3 attempts in 2/184 subjects). Suicidal ideation was reported by 3 sertraline-treated patients (1.6%) and"}

In the safety analysis, suicide attempt was reported in the same number of patients in sertraline (2/189, 1.1%) and placebo (2/184, 1.1%) with an incidence of suicide attempts in sertraline-treated subjects of 1.1% (2 attempts in 2/189 subjects) versus 1.6% in placebo-treated subjects (3 attempts in 2/184 subjects). Suicidal ideation was reported by 3 sertraline-treated patients (1.6%) and no placebo treated patients. This difference is not statistically significant. Note that sertraline should not be used in children and adolescents to treat MDD (see Section 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE). Post-marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events reported from the clinical trials above, the following adverse events, which are not necessarily related to ZOLOFT, as adverse events are also reported in the context of post-marketing exposure, when the relationship of these adverse events to ZOLOFT may not be differentiated clearly from effects of concomitant medications or disease states for which ZOLOFT was prescribed. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Rare: Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia Immune system disorders: Uncommon: Hypersensitivity Rare: Anaphylactoid reaction Endocrine disorders: Rare: Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, hyperprolactinaemia, hypothyroidism Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Common: Increased appetite ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 15 Rare: Diabetes mellitus, hyponatraemia, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia Psychiatric disorders: Uncommon: Hallucination, aggression, confusional state, depressive symptoms, euphoric mood Rare: Psychotic disorder, mania Nervous system disorders: Very common: Headache Common: Hypertonia, paraesthesia Uncommon: Syncope, muscle contractions involuntary, migraine Rare: Coma, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, visual field defect Unknown: amnesia.

This study was conducted in clinical practice settings in children and adolescents with primary diagnoses of obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, or other anxiety disorders and evaluated cognition [assessed by the Trails B test and the Metacognition (BRIEF), behavioural/emotional regulation (assessed by the Behavioural Regulation Index from the BRIEF) and physical/pubertal maturation (assessed by standardised height/weight/body mass index (BMI) and Tanner Stage)]. Sertraline is approved in the paediatric population only for patients aged 6 years of age and older with OCD (see Section 4.1 THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS). Inventory of Executive Function the Behaviour Rating Index from Standardisation of each primary outcome measure based on sex and age norms showed that the overall results were consistent with normal development. No statistically significant differences were observed for the primary outcome measures, with the exception of weight. A statistically significant finding for standardised weight was observed in comparative analyses and observed mainly at higher doses of sertraline. However, the magnitude of the change in weight was small [mean (SD) change in standardised z-scores = 0.17 (0.6)]. Reporting Suspected Adverse Effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions at www.tga.gov.au/reporting-problems. 4.9 OVERDOSE On the evidence available, sertraline has a wide margin of safety in overdose. Overdoses in adults of 700 to 2100 mg have not resulted in serious symptoms. Ingestion of 4000 mg resulted in seizures in an adolescent. The largest known ingestion is 13.5 g with recovery reported. Another overdose of 2.5 g of sertraline alone resulted in death. Overdosage of 400 and 500 mg in two children have resulted in serotonin syndrome. Signs and Symptoms Symptoms of overdose include serotonin-mediated side effects such as electrocardiogram QT prolonged, TdP (see Sections 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE, 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS and 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES, Clinical trials), somnolence, gastrointestinal disturbances (such as nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting), tachycardia, tremor, agitation and dizziness. Other important adverse events reported with sertraline overdose (single or multiple drugs) include bradycardia, bundle branch block, coma, convulsions, delirium, hallucinations, hypertension, hypotension, manic reaction, pancreatitis, QT-interval prolongation, stupor and syncope. Hyperthermia, increased respirations and cutaneous vasodilation have also been reported. Minor ECG abnormalities, palpitations, prolonged tachycardia and increased pulse rate have also been reported following paediatric overdose. Seizures have been reported rarely. Serotonin syndrome may result following significant overdose, and onset may be delayed. A death due to asthma exacerbation has been reported following sertraline overdose. Deaths have been reported involving overdoses of sertraline, primarily in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol. Therefore any overdosage should be treated aggressively. Elevated liver enzymes and elevated creatine phosphokinase levels have been noted following acute overdose. Hyponatraemia secondary to SIADH has been reported following overdose and has been severe enough to cause seizures. Treatment of Overdosage In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any antidepressant. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring is recommended along with general symptomatic and supportive measures. Establish ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 18 and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, if necessary. Patients should be monitored for potential cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or hepatic abnormalities. Also monitor for signs/symptoms of serotonin syndrome (mental status changes, hyperthermia, myoclonus, autonomic instability, high CK levels) and possible seizures. There are no specific antidotes for sertraline. Activated charcoal should be considered in treating overdose and is most effective when administered within one hour of ingestion. In patients who are not fully conscious or have impaired gag reflex, consideration should be given to administering activated charcoal via nasogastric tube once the airway is protected. Routine use of a cathartic with activated charcoal is not recommended as there is no evidence that cathartics reduce drug absorption and cathartics are known to cause adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, electrolyte imbalances and occasionally hypotension. Induction of emesis is not recommended because of the potential for CNS depression and seizures. Due to the large volume of distribution of sertraline, forced diuresis, dialysis, haemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. For information on the management of overdose, contact the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 (Australia). 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Mechanism of Action ZOLOFT is an antidepressant, the active ingredient sertraline hydrochloride is chemically unrelated to tricyclic, tetracyclic or other available antidepressant agents. The mechanism of action of sertraline is presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin (5HT). Studies at clinically relevant doses in man have demonstrated that sertraline blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that sertraline is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on noradrenaline and dopamine neuronal reuptake. In vitro studies have shown that sertraline has no significant affinity to adrenergic (alpha1, alpha2, beta), cholinergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopaminergic, histaminergic, serotonergic (5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2) or benzodiazepine receptors; antagonism of such receptors has been hypothesised to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs. The chronic administration of sertraline was found in animals to down regulate brain noradrenaline receptors as has been observed with other clinically effective antidepressant and anti- obsessional drugs. Sertraline does not inhibit monoamine oxidase. Drugs known to influence serotonin receptors in animals and isolated cell preparations have been used to investigate possible 5HT receptor abnormalities in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). No clear picture has emerged, but OCD symptoms were worsened by meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), a mixed agonist at serotonin receptors in untreated OCD patients in comparison to healthy controls, but not after patients had been treated with the non-selective 5HT reuptake inhibitor clomipramine. Tricyclic antidepressants without SRI effects have no efficacy in OCD. Clinical Trials Major Depression Adults The efficacy of ZOLOFT in the treatment of a major depressive episode in adults was established in controlled trials of six to eight weeks in outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III category of major depressive disorder. Efficacy and safety have been established in studies up to 24"}

Clinical Trials Major Depression Adults The efficacy of ZOLOFT in the treatment of a major depressive episode in adults was established in controlled trials of six to eight weeks in outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III category of major depressive disorder. Efficacy and safety have been established in studies up to 24 weeks. ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 19 A major depressive episode implies a prominent and relatively persistent depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks); it should include at least 4 of the following 8 symptoms; change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. The antidepressant action of ZOLOFT in hospitalised depressed patients has not been adequately studied. A study of depressed outpatients who had responded to ZOLOFT during an initial eight-week open treatment phase and were then randomised to continuation on ZOLOFT or placebo demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate over the next eight weeks for patients taking ZOLOFT compared to those on placebo. Therefore, the physician who elects to use ZOLOFT for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Children and Adolescents The effectiveness of ZOLOFT for the treatment of OCD was first demonstrated in a 12-week, multicentre, parallel group study in a paediatric outpatient population (children and adolescents, ages 6-17). Patients in this study were initiated at doses of either 25 mg/day (children, ages 6-12) or 50 mg/day (adolescents, ages 13-17), and then titrated over the next four weeks to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day, if tolerated. The mean dose for completers was 178 mg/day. Dosing was once a day in the morning or evening. Patients in this study had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS) total score of 22. Patients receiving sertraline experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the CYBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the mean 3 point reduction for placebo patients. Analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex. The safety of ZOLOFT use in children and adolescents, ages 6-18, for 52 weeks, was established in a flexible- dose, open extension study of 137 patients who had completed the initial 12-week, double-blind, placebo- controlled study. ZOLOFT was administered at doses of either 25 mg/day (children, ages 6-12) or 50 mg/day (adolescents, ages 13-18) and then titrated in weekly 25 mg/day or 50 mg/day increments, respectively, to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day based upon clinical response. The mean dose for completers was 157 mg/day. In this 52-week study ZOLOFT was well tolerated with an adverse event profile generally similar to that observed in the acute 12-week paediatric study. In the 12-week study, a marginally greater number of sertraline-treated patients (90%) experienced one or more adverse events (irrespective of causality), when compared to placebo (73%). The majority of adverse events in the sertraline group were classified as mild to moderate in severity. Adults The efficacy and safety of ZOLOFT in the treatment of OCD were established in three eight to twelve week controlled trials of non-depressed adult outpatients with mild, moderate, or severe OCD, diagnosed on the basis of DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria. Efficacy and safety were maintained in a 40 week continuation of the 12 week fixed-dose, placebo-controlled study. In patients with OCD, the obsessions or compulsions must cause marked distress, be time-consuming, or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning in order to meet the DSM-III-R diagnosis of OCD. Obsessions are recurrent, persistent ideas, thoughts, images, or impulses that are ego-dystonic. Compulsions are repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviours performed in response to an obsession or in a stereotyped fashion, and are recognised by the person as excessive or unreasonable. In three double-blind, multicentre, parallel group, placebo-controlled trials, both clinically relevant and statistically significant improvements in response rates (40%) were noted in sertraline treatment groups. In a 12-week double-blind fixed-dose placebo-controlled study in OCD, 26% of patients receiving placebo were regarded as responders to therapy, whereas 40% of patients receiving sertraline were regarded as responders. ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 20 Long-term treatment In an open extension study of the 40-week continuation study mentioned above, 38 patients treated with sertraline received 2 full years of sertraline treatment. Sertraline responders treated for more than one year continued improvement during a second year of open treatment. In addition, to assess the efficacy of sertraline in preventing relapse in patients who had achieved a sustained response during 52 weeks of single-blind sertraline therapy, a 28-week double-blind, placebo-controlled extension study of 223 patients demonstrated continued significant improvement in OCD symptoms when compared to placebo, with completion rates in the sertraline and placebo groups of 70% and 48%, respectively. Panic Disorder Adults The efficacy and safety of ZOLOFT in the treatment of panic disorder in adults has been evaluated in four double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials for up to 12 weeks: two flexible-dose studies and two fixed dose studies. At the last week of treatment (week 10 or 12), both flexible-dose studies and one of the fixed dose studies showed statistically significant differences from placebo in favour of ZOLOFT in terms of mean change from baseline in the total number of DSM-III-R defined panic attacks (last observation carried forward analysis). As the flexible-dose studies were of identical protocol, data for these investigations can be pooled. The mean number of full panic attacks at baseline was 6.2/week (N=167) in the ZOLOFT group and 5.4/week in the placebo group (N=175). At week 10 (last observation carried forward analysis), the mean changes from baseline were 4.9/week and 2.5/week for the ZOLOFT and placebo groups, respectively. The proportion of patients having no panic attacks at the final evaluation was 69% in the ZOLOFT group and 57% in the placebo group. The mean daily dose administered at the last week of treatment was approximately 120 mg (range: 25- 200 mg) in the flexible-dose studies. All patients entered into clinical trials had a DSM-IIIR diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. It was found in the flexible-dose studies that initiating treatment at 25 mg/day for one week led to a lower incidence of early discontinuations. The primary efficacy measure was the number of DSM-III-R defined panic attacks occurring each week. Secondary efficacy variables measured included the Sheehan Panic and Anticipatory Anxiety Scale (PAAS), Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A) Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) rating of severity of Illness and Improvement. The statistically significant superiority of sertraline over placebo in the treatment of panic disorder was demonstrated by the reduction in the number of panic attacks per week at study endpoint. Analyses of the secondary efficacy variables confirmed that the reduction in panic attack frequency was associated with significant improvement in a broad range of disease symptoms. No clear dose-dependency has been demonstrated over the 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day dose range investigated in the fixed dose studies. Efficacy beyond 12 weeks has not been assessed. Social Phobia (Social Anxiety Disorder) Adults The effectiveness of ZOLOFT in the treatment of Social Phobia (Social Anxiety Disorder) was established in two multicentre placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for Social Phobia (Social Anxiety Disorder). These criteria involve a marked and persistent fear or anxiety of behaving in an embarrassing or humiliating manner while under the gaze of other people in one or more social or performance situations. Exposure to the social or performance situation almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response. The patient recognises that the fear is excessive or unreasonable. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared social or performance situation(s) interferes significantly with the patient’s normal routine, occupational (academic) functioning, or social activities, or relationships, or there is marked distress about having the phobia. Performance anxiety, stage fright and shyness in social situations involving unfamiliar people should not be diagnosed as Social Phobia (Social Anxiety Disorder) unless the anxiety or avoidance leads to clinically significant impairment or marked distress. ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 21 A 12-week, multicentre, flexible-dose study compared ZOLOFT (50 mg/day to 200 mg/day) to placebo, in which ZOLOFT was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week. Study outcome was assessed by (a) the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), and by (b) the proportion of responders as defined by the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) criterion of CGI-I ≤ 2 (very much or much improved). ZOLOFT was significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the LSAS and the percentage of responders. A 20-week, multicentre, flexible-dose study compared ZOLOFT (50 mg/day to 200 mg/day) to placebo. Study outcome was assessed by the (a) Duke Brief Social Phobia Scale (BSPS), (b) the Marks Fear Questionnaire Social Phobia Subscale (FQ-SPS), and (c) the CGI-I responder criterion of ≤ 2. ZOLOFT was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the BSPS total score and fear, avoidance and physiologic factor scores, as well as the FQ-SPS total score, and to have significantly more responders than placebo as defined by the CGI-I. In a 24-week extension study of the 20-week study, patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for Social Phobia (Social Anxiety Disorder) who had responded to ZOLOFT during the 20-week placebo-controlled trial were randomised to continuation of ZOLOFT or to substitution of placebo for up to 24 weeks of observation for relapse. Patients receiving ZOLOFT continuation treatment experienced a significantly lower relapse rate than patients randomised to placebo substitution.

Exposure-response analysis indicated a slightly positive relationship between QTcF and sertraline plasma concentrations [0.036 msec/(ng/mL); p < 0.0001]. Based on the exposure-response model, the threshold for clinically significant prolongation of the QTcF (ie, for predicted 90% CI to exceed 10 msec) is at least 2.6- fold greater than the average Cmax (86 ng/mL) following the highest recommended dose of sertraline (200 mg/day) (see Sections 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE, 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES and OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS, 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) and 4.9 OVERDOSE). Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) Adults The effectiveness of ZOLOFT for the treatment of PMDD was established in two double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled flexible-dose trials (Studies 1 and 2) conducted over three menstrual cycles. Patients in Study 1 met DSM-III-R criteria for Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), the clinical entity now referred to as PMDD in DSM-IV. Patients in Study 2 met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. The DSM-IV criteria include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. These symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses. The disturbance markedly interferes with work or school or with usual social activities and relationships by prospective daily ratings during at least two consecutive symptomatic cycles. Efficacy was assessed with the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), a patient-rated instrument that includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms. Other efficacy assessments included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), and the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scores. In Study 1, involving n=251 randomised patients, ZOLOFT treatment was initiated at 50 mg/day and administered daily throughout the menstrual cycle. In subsequent cycles, patients were dosed in the range of 50-150 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and tolerance. In Study 2, involving n=281 randomised patients, ZOLOFT treatment was initiated at 50 mg/day in the late luteal phase (last 2 weeks) of each menstrual cycle and then discontinued at the onset of menses. In subsequent ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 22 cycles, patients were dosed in the range of 50-100 mg/day in the luteal phase of each cycle, on the basis of clinical response and tolerance. Patients who were titrated to 100 mg/day received 50 mg/day for the first 3 days of the cycle, then 100 mg/day for the remainder of the cycle. ZOLOFT administered continuously (Study 1) or intermittently (Study 2) was significantly more effective than placebo on all primary efficacy parameters as shown in Table 1.

The average terminal elimination half-life of plasma sertraline is about 26 hours. Based on this pharmacokinetic parameter, steady- state sertraline plasma levels should be achieved after approximately one week of once-daily dosing. Linear dose-proportional pharmacokinetics was demonstrated in a single dose study in which the Cmax and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of sertraline were proportional to dose over a range of 50 mg to 200 mg. Consistent with the terminal elimination half-life, there is an approximately two-fold accumulation, compared to a single dose of sertraline, with repeated dosing over a 50 mg to 200 mg dose range. The single- dose bioavailability of sertraline tablets is approximately equal to an equivalent dose of solution. The effects of food on the bioavailability of sertraline were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. AUC was slightly increased when drug was administered with food but the Cmax was 25% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration decreased from 8 hours post-dosing to 5.5 hours. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Animal studies indicate that sertraline has a large apparent volume of distribution. Distribution In vitro protein binding studies performed with radiolabelled 3H-sertraline showed that sertraline is highly bound to serum proteins (98%) in the range of 20 to 500 ng/mL. However, at up to 300 and 200 ng/mL concentrations respectively, sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline did not alter the plasma protein binding of two other highly protein-bound drugs, viz., warfarin and propranolol (see Section 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE). Metabolism Sertraline undergoes extensive first pass metabolism. The principal initial pathway of metabolism for sertraline is N-demethylation. Excretion N-desmethylsertraline has a plasma terminal elimination half-life of 62 to 104 hours. Both in vitro biochemical and in vivo pharmacological testing have shown N-desmethylsertraline to be substantially less active than sertraline. Both sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline undergo oxidative deamination and subsequent reduction, hydroxylation and glucuronide conjugation. In a study of radiolabelled sertraline involving two healthy male subjects, sertraline accounted for less than 5% of the plasma radioactivity. About ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 23 40 to 45% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine in 9 days. Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in the urine. For the same period, about 40 to 45% of the administered radioactivity was accounted for in faeces, including 12 to 14% unchanged sertraline. Desmethylsertraline exhibits time-related, dose dependent increases in AUC(0-24 hour), Cmax and Cmin with about a 5 to 9 fold increase in these pharmacokinetic parameters between day 1 and day 14. Special Populations Children and Adolescents The pharmacokinetics of sertraline in paediatric OCD patients have been shown to be comparable to adults (although paediatric patients metabolise sertraline with slightly greater efficiency). However, lower doses may be advisable for paediatric patients, given their lower body weights (especially those patients aged 6 to 12 years), in order to avoid excessive plasma levels. Adults Sertraline plasma clearance were compared in male and female young subjects (18 to 45 years) and elderly subjects (≥ 65 years) in an open-label, multiple-dose study. Eleven subjects in each group received sertraline once daily for 30 days according to a titrated regimen up to 200 mg/day. No significant differences in Cmax, AUC or elimination half-life were found for the young women or the elderly of either sex. In comparison, Cmax and AUC were lower and half-life shorter in young men. Thus the elimination of sertraline appears to be slightly more rapid in young males. Although these differences are statistically significant, they are unlikely to be clinically significant. The ratios of sertraline clearance to desmethylsertraline clearance of the four groups were similar. Hepatic Impairment Sertraline is extensively metabolised by the liver. A multiple dose pharmacokinetic study in subjects with mild, stable cirrhosis administered sertraline 50 mg/day for 21 days demonstrated a prolonged elimination half-life and approximately a three-fold greater AUC and Cmax for sertraline and a two-fold greater AUC and Cmax for the metabolite in comparison to normal subjects. Patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. If ZOLOFT is administered to patients with hepatic impairment a lower or less frequent dose should be considered (see Sections 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE and 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION). Renal Impairment In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 mL/min to 60 mL/min) or moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 mL/min to 29 mL/min) administered sertraline 50 mg/day for 21 days multiple dose pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-24 or Cmax) were not statistically significantly different compared with controls. This indicates that ZOLOFT dosing does not have to be adjusted based on degree of renal impairment. 5.3 PRECLINICAL SAFETY DATA Genotoxicity Sertraline had no genotoxic effects, with or without metabolic activation, based on the following assays; bacterial mutation assay; mouse lymphoma mutation assay; and tests for cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human lymphocytes. Carcinogenicity The carcinogenic potential of sertraline has not been fully elucidated. Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were carried out in CD-1 mice and Long-Evans rats (at doses up to 40 mg/kg), giving rise to plasma drug exposure levels similar to or slightly higher than that achieved following the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mg. There was a dose-related increase in the incidence of liver adenomas in male mice receiving sertraline at 10 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg. No increase was seen in female mice or in rats of either sex receiving the same treatments, nor was there an increase in hepatocellular carcinomas. Liver adenomas have a variable rate of ZOLOFT® – PRODUCT INFORMATION 24 spontaneous occurrence in the CD-1 mouse and are of unknown significance to humans. There was an increase in follicular adenomas of the thyroid in female rats receiving sertraline at 40 mg/kg; this was not accompanied by thyroid hyperplasia. While there was an increase in uterine adenocarcinomas in rats receiving sertraline at 10 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg"}

What should I know while using Wegovy®? 6. 7. Are there any side effects? Product details How do I use Wegovy®? 1. Why am I using Wegovy®? Wegovy® contains the active ingredient semaglutide. Wegovy® is similar to a natural hormone called glucagon- like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that is released from the intestine after a meal. Wegovy® works by acting on receptors in the brain that control your appetite, causing you to feel fuller and less hungry and experience less craving for food. This will help you eat less food and reduce your body weight. Wegovy® is used for weight loss and weight maintenance in addition to diet and physical activity in adults, who have ⦁ ⦁ a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (obesity), or a BMI of 27 kg/m² and less than 30 kg/m² (overweight) and weight-related health problems. Wegovy® is used to reduce the risk of a heart disease related event in adults with a history heart disease who do not have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and have a BMI of 27 kg/m² or greater. BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. Wegovy® is used together with diet and physical activity for weight management in adolescents aged 12 years and above, who have obesity body weight >60 kg. ⦁ and ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ ⦁ You are allergic to semaglutide, or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include: o redness, swelling, rash and itching at the injection site rash, itching or hives on the skin shortness of breath o o o wheezing or difficulty breathing o swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body.
