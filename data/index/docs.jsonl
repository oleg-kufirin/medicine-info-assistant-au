JANUVIA can be taken with or without food. When JANUVIA is used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of sulfonylurea- or insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (see Section 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE, Hypoglycaemia in Combination with a Sulfonylurea or with Insulin). 1 Patients with Renal Impairment Because there is a dosage adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. For patients with eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, no dosage adjustment for JANUVIA is required. For patients with eGFR  30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, the dose of JANUVIA is 50 mg once daily. For patients with eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or with ESRD (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2), including those requiring haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, the dose of JANUVIA is 25 mg once daily.

JANUVIA may be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis. The use of JANUVIA in combination with insulin has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS JANUVIA is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any components of this product (See Section 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE, Hypersensitivity Reactions and 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS), Postmarketing Experience.). 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE General JANUVIA should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Pancreatitis There have been reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis (see Section 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS)), in patients taking sitagliptin. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. Resolution of pancreatitis has been observed after discontinuation of sitagliptin. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA and other potentially suspect medicinal products should be discontinued. Use in renal impairment Because JANUVIA is renally excreted, to achieve plasma concentrations of JANUVIA similar to those in patients with normal renal function, lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR< 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, as well as in ESRD patients requiring haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (See Section 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION, Patients with"}

Because there is a dosage adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. The use of JANUVIA in combination with other antihyperglycaemic agents (i.e. metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones or insulin) has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. Hypoglycaemia in Combination with a Sulfonylurea or with Insulin In clinical trials of JANUVIA as monotherapy and JANUVIA as part of combination therapy with metformin or pioglitazone, rates of hypoglycaemia reported with JANUVIA were similar to rates in patients taking placebo. 2 As typical with other antihyperglycaemic agents used in combination with sulfonylurea or with insulin, hypoglycaemia has been observed when JANUVIA was used in combination with insulin or a sulfonylurea (see Section 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS)). Therefore, to reduce the risk of sulfonylurea- or insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be considered (see Section 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION).

Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes (See Section 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS and Section 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS), Postmarketing Experience). Arthralgia There have been post-marketing reports of joint pain, which may be severe, in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Onset of symptoms following initiation of treatment may be rapid or may occur after longer periods. Discontinuation of therapy should be considered in patients who present with or experience an exacerbation of joint symptoms during treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors. Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalisation have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor.

Use in the elderly In clinical studies, the safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA in the elderly ( 65 years) were comparable to those seen in younger patients (< 65 years). No dosage adjustment is required based on age. Elderly patients are more likely to have renal impairment; as with other patients, dosage adjustment may be required in the presence of significant renal impairment (see Section 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION, Patients with Renal impairment). Paediatric use Safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA in paediatric patients under 18 years have not been established. JANUVIA should not be used in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age because of insufficient efficacy (see Section 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES, Clinical trials). JANUVIA has not been studied in paediatric patients under 10 years of age. 3 Effects on laboratory tests The incidence of laboratory adverse experiences was similar in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo.

Across clinical studies, a small increase in white blood cell count (approximately 200 cells/microL difference in WBC vs placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells/microL) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This observation was seen in most but not all studies. This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant. 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS In vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6 and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a p-glycoprotein substrate, but does not inhibit p-glycoprotein mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilise these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, as described below, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glibenclamide, ertugliflozin, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic cationic transporter (OCT). Multiple doses of sitagliptin slightly increased digoxin concentrations; however, these increases are not considered likely to be clinically meaningful and are not attributed to a specific"}

Multiple doses of sitagliptin slightly increased digoxin concentrations; however, these increases are not considered likely to be clinically meaningful and are not attributed to a specific mechanism. Metformin: Coadministration of multiple twice-daily doses of sitagliptin with metformin, an OCT substrate, did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of OCT-mediated transport. Sulfonylureas: Single-dose pharmacokinetics of glibenclamide, a CYP2C9 substrate, were not meaningfully altered in subjects receiving multiple doses of sitagliptin. Clinically meaningful interactions would not be expected with other sulfonylureas (e.g., glipizide, tolbutamide, and glimepiride) which, like glibenclamide, are primarily eliminated by CYP2C9. Ertugliflozin: Single-dose administration of sitagliptin 100 mg had no clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of ertugliflozin 15 mg. The geometric mean ratios (GMR) and 90% CI (expressed as percentages) for ertugliflozin AUCinf and Cmax for coadministration with sitagliptin vs. ertugliflozin alone were 102.27% (99.72%, 104.89%) and 98.18% (91.20%, 105.70%), respectively. Simvastatin: Single-dose pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, a CYP3A4 substrate, were not meaningfully altered in subjects receiving multiple daily doses of sitagliptin. Therefore, sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Thiazolidinediones: Single-dose pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone were not meaningfully altered in subjects receiving multiple daily doses of sitagliptin. Therefore, sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP2C8-mediated metabolism. Clinically meaningful interactions with pioglitazone are not expected because pioglitazone predominantly undergoes CYP2C8- or 4"}

Thiazolidinediones: Single-dose pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone were not meaningfully altered in subjects receiving multiple daily doses of sitagliptin. Therefore, sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP2C8-mediated metabolism. Clinically meaningful interactions with pioglitazone are not expected because pioglitazone predominantly undergoes CYP2C8- or 4 CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Warfarin: Multiple daily doses of sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics, as assessed by measurement of S(-) or R(+) warfarin enantiomers, or pharmacodynamics (as assessed by measurement of prothrombin INR) of a single dose of warfarin. Since S(-) warfarin is primarily metabolised by CYP2C9, these data also support the conclusion that sitagliptin is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor. Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration with sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the steady- state pharmacokinetics of norethindrone or ethinyl estradiol. Digoxin: Sitagliptin had a minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Following administration of 0.25 mg digoxin concomitantly with 100 mg of JANUVIA daily for 10 days, the plasma AUC of digoxin was increased by 11%, and the plasma Cmax by 18%. These increases are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Effects of Other Drugs on Sitagliptin Clinical data described below suggest that sitagliptin is not susceptible to clinically meaningful interactions by coadministered medications: Ertugliflozin: No clinically meaningful change in sitagliptin exposure was observed following concomitant administration of a single 100 mg sitagliptin dose with 15 mg ertugliflozin compared to sitagliptin alone. The GMR and 90% CI (expressed as percentages) for sitagliptin AUCinf and Cmax for coadministration with ertugliflozin vs. sitagliptin alone"}

Metformin: Coadministration of multiple twice-daily doses of metformin with sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Ciclosporin: A study was conducted to assess the effect of ciclosporin, a potent inhibitor of p- glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Coadministration of a single 100 mg oral dose of JANUVIA and a single 600 mg oral dose of ciclosporin increased the AUC and Cmax of sitagliptin by approximately 29% and 68%, respectively. These modest changes in sitagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically meaningful. The renal clearance of sitagliptin was also not meaningfully altered. Therefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with other p-glycoprotein inhibitors. Population Pharmacokinetics: Population pharmacokinetic analyses have been conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes. Concomitant medications did not have a clinically meaningful effect on sitagliptin pharmacokinetics. Medications assessed were those that are commonly administered to patients with type 2 diabetes including, but not restricted to, cholesterol-lowering agents (including statins, fibrates, ezetimibe), anti-platelet agents (including clopidogrel), antihypertensives (including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, hydrochlorothiazide), analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (including naproxen, diclofenac, celecoxib), anti- depressants (including"}

Use with other antidiabetic agents The safety and efficacy of sitagliptin in combination with GLP-1 mimetics, or alpha- glucosidase inhibitors has not been established. Other Drugs Sitagliptin has not been studied in combination with orlistat. 5 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on fertility No adverse effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats given sitagliptin orally at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 100 times the AUC in humans at the clinical dose of 100 mg/day) prior to and throughout mating. Use in Pregnancy (Category B3) Sitagliptin was not teratogenic in rats at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg/day or in rabbits given up to 125 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (up to 32 and 22 times, respectively, the AUC in humans at the clinical dose of 100 mg/day). A slight increase in the incidence of foetal rib abnormalities (absent, hypoplastic and wavy ribs) was observed among foetuses of rats given sitagliptin at 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 100 times the AUC in humans at 100 mg/day).

Pups of rats administered sitagliptin at 1000 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20 showed reduced birth weight and postnatal body weight gain (observed prior to and after weaning). No functional or behavioural toxicity was observed in the offspring of treated rats. Sitagliptin crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with JANUVIA in pregnant women. JANUVIA, like other oral antihyperglycaemic agents, is not recommended for use in pregnancy. Use in Lactation Treatment of rats with sitagliptin during pregnancy and lactation caused decreased pup body weight gain (see Use in Pregnancy). Sitagliptin is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. It is not known whether sitagliptin is excreted in human milk. Therefore, JANUVIA should not be used by a woman who is nursing. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES No studies of the effects of JANUVIA on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, JANUVIA is not expected to affect the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Clinical Trials In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin or pioglitazone, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycaemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse"}

Reporting suspected adverse effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions at www.tga.gov.au/reporting-problems. 4.9 OVERDOSE For information on the management of overdose, contact the Poison Information Centre on 13 11 26 (Australia). During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg JANUVIA were generally well tolerated. Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in one study at a dose of 800 mg JANUVIA (see Section 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES, Cardiac Electrophysiology). There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in humans. In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose- related clinical adverse reactions observed with JANUVIA with doses of up to 400 mg per day for periods of up to 28 days. In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and"}

Sitagliptin is modestly dialysable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session. Prolonged haemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialysable by peritoneal dialysis. 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Mechanism of action Sitagliptin is a member of a class of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes by enhancing the levels of active incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signalling pathways involving cyclic AMP. Treatment with GLP-1 or with DPP- 4 inhibitors in animal models of type 2 diabetes has been demonstrated to improve beta cell 12 responsiveness to glucose and stimulate insulin biosynthesis and release. With higher insulin levels, tissue glucose uptake is"}

Treatment with GLP-1 or with DPP- 4 inhibitors in animal models of type 2 diabetes has been demonstrated to improve beta cell 12 responsiveness to glucose and stimulate insulin biosynthesis and release. With higher insulin levels, tissue glucose uptake is enhanced. In addition, GLP-1 lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells. Decreased glucagon concentrations, along with higher insulin levels, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, resulting in a decrease in blood glucose levels. The effects of GLP-1 and GIP are glucose-dependent. When blood glucose concentrations are low, stimulation of insulin release and suppression of glucagon secretion by GLP-1 are not observed. For both GLP-1 and GIP, stimulation of insulin secretion is markedly enhanced as glucose rises above normal concentrations. GLP-1 does not impair the normal glucagon response to hypoglycaemia. The activity of GLP-1 and GIP is limited by the DPP-4 enzyme, which rapidly hydrolyses the incretin hormones to produce inactive products. Sitagliptin prevents the hydrolysis of incretin hormones by DPP-4, thereby increasing plasma concentrations of the active forms of GLP-1 and GIP. By enhancing active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. This glucose-dependent mechanism is unlike the mechanism seen with sulfonylureas where insulin is released even when glucose levels are low, which can lead to hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and in normal subjects. In patients with type 2 diabetes with hyperglycaemia, these changes in insulin and glucagon levels lead"}

In patients with type 2 diabetes with hyperglycaemia, these changes in insulin and glucagon levels lead to lower haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and lower fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. Sitagliptin inhibits DPP-4 with nanomolar potency (IC50 18 nM). It does not inhibit the closely-related enzymes DPP-8 or DPP-9 at therapeutic concentrations. Inhibition of DPP-8 or DPP-9 is associated with toxicity in preclinical animal models and alteration of immune function in vitro. Clinical trials Results from long-term studies of JANUVIA on overall morbidity and mortality outcomes are not available. There were 4911 patients with type 2 diabetes randomised in eight double-blind, placebo- controlled Phase III clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycaemic control as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, pioglitazone, glimepiride, glimepiride+metformin and insulin (with or without metformin). Co-morbid diseases were common in the patients studied in a pooled analysis of five of these studies: 58% of patients had hypertension, 54% had dyslipidaemia, and more than 50% were obese (BMI  30 kg/m2).

The studies that support registration in general used the reduction in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as the primary outcome variable. Pre-specified secondary endpoints included FPG and 2-hour PPG. An additional double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted in 91 patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe renal impairment. An active (glipizide)-controlled study of 52-weeks duration was conducted in 1172 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control on metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced statistically significant improvements in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Clinically significant improvements in HbA1c were maintained for 52 weeks. Treatment with JANUVIA showed suggestions of improvement in measures of beta cell function (see Section 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTICS, Mechanism of action). Clinical Studies Monotherapy A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two double-blind, placebo- controlled studies, one of 18-week and another of 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA monotherapy. Patients with inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c 7% 13 to 10%) were randomized to receive a 100 mg (443 patients) or 200 mg dose (456 patients) of JANUVIA or placebo (363 patients) once daily.

JANUVIA as monotherapy is indicated for use when metformin cannot be used (see Section 4.1 THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS). Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (see Table 4 and Table 5). These studies included patients with a wide range of baseline HbA1c. The improvement in HbA1c compared to placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycaemic therapy, baseline BMI, presence of metabolic syndrome, or a standard index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Patients with a shorter length of time since diagnosis of diabetes (< 3 years) or with higher baseline HbA1c had greater reductions in HbA1c. In the 18- and 24-week studies, among patients who were not on an antihyperglycaemic agent at study entry, the reduction from baseline in HbA1c was -0.67% (95% CI -0.87, -0.48) and -0.85% (95% CI -1.02, -0.68), respectively, for those given JANUVIA and -0.10% (95% CI -0.39, 0.19) and -0.18% (95% CI -0.35, -0.02), respectively, for those given placebo.

Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to have been kept constant. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10.3 mg. The objective of the study was to test whether sitagliptin was not inferior to glipizide, at a non-inferiority margin of 0.3%. After 52 weeks, both treatments resulted in a statistically significant improvement in glycaemic control from baseline. The reduction from baseline in HbA1c (primary endpoint) was 0.67% for JANUVIA 100 mg daily and 0.67% for glipizide, confirming the noninferiority of JANUVIA compared to glipizide. With respect to other analyses, the reduction in FPG was 0.56 mmol/L for JANUVIA and 0.42 mmol/L for glipizide. In a post-hoc analysis, patients with higher baseline HbA1c (≥ 9%) in both groups had greater reductions from baseline in HbA1c (JANUVIA, -1.68%; glipizide, -1.76%). The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the JANUVIA group (4.9%) was significantly lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%).

Importantly, the effect size and the durability of these improvements over 104-106 weeks were similar to those observed in the active-comparator groups. The observed reduction in glycaemic efficacy after initial improvement is believed to be a consequence of the natural history of the disease with continued loss of -cell function, and/or an additional increase in insulin resistance, and/or diminishing compliance with diet and exercise, and is similar to that observed with 29 other classes of antihyperglycaemic therapies.

Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin were generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Since coadministration of a high-fat meal with JANUVIA had no effect on the pharmacokinetics, JANUVIA may be administered with or without food. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100 mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 litres. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Metabolism Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine, and metabolism is a minor pathway. 31 Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine. Following a [14C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin.

Excretion Following administration of an oral [14C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. The apparent terminal t1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein, which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, ciclosporin, a p-glycoprotein inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Characteristics in Patients Renal Impairment A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of JANUVIA (50 mg dose) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to normal healthy control subjects. The study included patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, as well as patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis. In addition, the effects of renal impairment on sitagliptin"}

The study included patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, as well as patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis. In addition, the effects of renal impairment on sitagliptin pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (including ESRD) were assessed using population pharmacokinetic analyses. Compared to normal healthy control subjects, plasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased by approximately 1.2-fold and 1.6-fold in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), respectively. Because increases of this magnitude are not clinically relevant, dosage adjustment in these patients is not necessary. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin was increased approximately 2-fold in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2), and approximately 4-fold in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), including patients with ESRD on haemodialysis. Sitagliptin was modestly removed by haemodialysis (13.5% over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session starting 4 hours postdose). To achieve plasma concentrations of sitagliptin similar to those in patients with normal renal function, lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR<45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (See Section 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION, Patients with Renal Impairment).

These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. No dosage adjustment for JANUVIA is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 32 There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score > 9). However, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, severe hepatic impairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Elderly Patients No dosage adjustment is required based on age. Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase II data. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects.

Carcinogenicity A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of focal eosinophilic cellular alterations in the liver in both sexes at 150 mg/kg/day and at 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of basophilic cellular alterations in females at 500 mg/kg/day. Eosinophilic and basophilic cellular alterations are regarded as preneoplastic lesions. There 33 was an increase in hepatic adenomas and carcinomas in males, and hepatic carcinomas in females at 500 mg/kg/day. Systemic exposure in rats at 150 and 500 mg/kg/day are 19 and 58 times, respectively, that of humans at 100 mg/day. The no-observed effect level for induction of hepatic neoplasia in rats was 150 mg/kg/day, producing exposure approximately 19-fold higher than the human exposure at the 100 mg/day clinical dose.

Doses greater than 100 mg are not recommended. Vildagliptin can be administered orally with or without a meal. The 50 mg dose should be administered once daily in the morning. The 100 mg daily dose should be administered as two divided doses of 50 mg taken in the morning and evening. 1 If a dose of Galvus is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. A double dose should not be taken on the same day. As monotherapy The recommended dose of Galvus is 50 mg twice daily (100 mg daily dose) for monotherapy. In dual combination therapy When used in dual combination with metformin or a thiazolidinedione (clinical experience is with pioglitazone as dual therapy), the recommended dose of vildagliptin is 50 mg once daily or 100 mg (50 mg twice) daily.

In triple combination therapy The recommended dose of Galvus is 100mg daily (50 mg twice a day) for triple combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea. Patients with hepatic impairment Vildagliptin is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment including patients with a pre-treatment ALT or AST > 2.5x the ULN. Patients with renal impairment Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is to be estimated prior to commencement of therapy. No dosage adjustment of vildagliptin is required in patients with mild chronic kidney disease (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73m2). In patients with moderate (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m2) or severe (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73m2) renal impairment or End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), the recommended dose of vildagliptin is 50 mg once daily (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use-Use in renal impairment, Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties, Clinical trials and Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties, Special populations).

However, renal function typically declines in elderly patients which increases overall exposure and peak plasma concentration of vildagliptin. No dosage adjustments are necessary in the elderly patients with mild renal impairment. For elderly patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, or End Stage Renal Disease, similar dosing adjustment should be followed as for younger patients (See Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties, Special Populations, and Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration, Patients with renal impairment). 2 Paediatric patients Vildagliptin has not been studied in patients under 18 years of age; therefore, the use of vildagliptin in paediatric patients is not recommended (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties, Special Populations). 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to vildagliptin or to any of the excipients. 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE Vildagliptin is not a substitute for insulin in patients requiring insulin.

Clinical experience in patients with NYHA functional class III treated with vildagliptin is still limited and the results are inconclusive (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties, Clinical Trials). There is no experience of vildagliptin use in clinical trials in patients with NYHA functional class IV and therefore use is not recommended in these patients. Acute pancreatitis Use of vildagliptin has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, vildagliptin should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, vildagliptin should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of acute pancreatitis. Other Vildagliptin tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.

LFTs should be performed prior to the initiation of treatment with vildagliptin. LFTs should be monitored during vildagliptin treatment at three-month intervals during the first year and periodically thereafter. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored with a second liver function evaluation to confirm the finding and be followed thereafter with frequent liver function tests until the abnormality(ies) return to normal. Should an increase in AST or ALT of 3x ULN or 3 greater persist, withdrawal of therapy with vildagliptin is recommended. Patients who develop jaundice or other signs suggestive of liver dysfunction should discontinue vildagliptin and contact their physician immediately. Following withdrawal of treatment with vildagliptin and LFT normalisation, vildagliptin should not be reinitiated. Use in renal impairment There is limited experience in patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis. Therefore, Galvus should be used cautiously in these patients.

Arthralgia There have been post-marketing reports of joint pain, which may be severe, in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Onset of symptoms following initiation of treatment may be rapid or may occur after longer periods. Discontinuation of therapy should be considered in patients who present with or experience an exacerbation of joint symptoms during treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors. Bullous pemphigoid Post-marketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalisation have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving Galvus. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, Galvus should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment. 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS Vildagliptin has low potential for drug interaction. Since vildagliptin is not a cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzyme substrate and does not inhibit or induce CYP P450 enzymes, it is not likely to interact with the concomitant medications that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes."}

Drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with the following commonly co- 4 prescribed medications for patients with type 2 diabetes or medications with a narrow therapeutic window. Glibenclamide Coadministration of vildagliptin (100 mg twice daily) with glibenclamide (10 mg once daily) had no significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin. Vildagliptin did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of glibenclamide. Pioglitazone Coadministration of vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) with pioglitazone (45 mg once daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin.

Coadministration of vildagliptin with valsartan resulted in an increased exposure to valsartan (AUC by 24% and Cmax by 14%). However, these changes are not considered to be clinically relevant. Ramipril Coadministration of vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) with ramipril (5 mg once daily) to healthy subjects, did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ramipril and its active metabolite, ramiprilat. Similarly, ramipril did not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin. Simvastatin Coadministration of vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) with simvastatin (80 mg once daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and its active metabolite, simvastatin hydroxyacid. Similarly, simvastatin did not influence the steady-state pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin.

Coadministration of vildagliptin did not affect the pharmacodynamic parameters of prothrombin times such as AUCPT, PTmax, AUCINR, INRmax following administration of warfarin 25 mg in comparison with coadministration of placebo. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on fertility No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for Galvus. Vildagliptin did not impair male or female fertility or early embryonic development in rats at oral doses corresponding to 160 times human exposure at the maximum clinical dose. Use in pregnancy – Pregnancy Category B3 Vildagliptin was not teratogenic in either rats or rabbits at exposures up to ca 115 times and 40 times the maximum expected human exposure, respectively. A slight treatment-related increase in the incidence of fetal rib abnormalities was observed in the fetuses of rats at oral doses of 225 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the human AUC exposure at the 100 mg dose).

A slight treatment-related increase in the incidence of fetal rib abnormalities was observed in the fetuses of rats at oral doses of 225 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the human AUC exposure at the 100 mg dose). There is insufficient experience with Galvus in pregnant women. Vildagliptin should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Attainment of strict normoglycaemia during pregnancy may require conversion to insulin monotherapy. Use in lactation Vildagliptin is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. As it is not known whether vildagliptin is excreted in human milk, vildagliptin should not be administered to breastfeeding mother. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Patients who may experience dizziness should therefore avoid driving vehicles or using machines. 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Reporting suspected adverse effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions at www.tga.gov.au/reporting-problems. The safety and tolerability of vildagliptin (50 mg qd, 50 mg bid and 100 mg qd) have been assessed by pooling data from more than 11,500 patients from 38 Phase II and III studies (including 3 open label studies) ranging in duration from 12 to"}

The studies used in this pooled analysis have assessed vildagliptin as monotherapy, add-on therapy to other oral anti-diabetic agents (metformin, TZD, SU and insulin) and as an initial combination therapy with metformin or pioglitazone. Patients not receiving vildagliptin (all comparators group) were taking only placebo or metformin, TZD, SU, acarbose or insulin. For the calculation of frequency of adverse drug reactions for the individual indications, safety data from a subset 6 of pivotal controlled trials of at least 12 week’s duration was considered. Safety data were obtained from patients exposed to vildagliptin at a daily dose of 50 mg (once daily) or 100 mg (50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once daily) who received vildagliptin as monotherapy or in combination with another agent. The majority of adverse reactions in these trials were mild and transient, not requiring treatment discontinuations. No association was found between adverse reactions and age, gender, ethnicity, duration of exposure or daily dose.

At 600 mg, one subject experienced oedema of the feet and hands, and an excessive increase in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, accompanied by elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein, and myoglobin. Three additional subjects in this dose group presented with oedema of both feet, accompanied by paraesthesia in two cases. At 400 mg, there were three cases of muscle pain, and individual cases of mild and transient paraesthesia, fever, oedema and transient increase in 13 lipase levels (twice the ULN). All adverse events and laboratory abnormalities resolved after study drug discontinuation. GALVUS is not dialysable, however the major hydrolysis metabolite (LAY151) can be removed by haemodialysis. 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Pharmacotherapeutic group, ATC code Drugs used in diabetes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, ATC code: A10BH02. Mechanism of action Vildagliptin, a member of the class that enhances islet cell insulin secretion via an augmented incretin effect, is a high affinity dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that improves glycaemic control. The administration of vildagliptin results in rapid and near-complete inhibition of DPP-4 activity. Vildagliptin shows weak inhibition of, and rapid dissociation from DPP-8 and DPP-9, compared to DPP-4. In patients with type 2 diabetes, administration of vildagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. Vildagliptin inhibition"}

Vildagliptin shows weak inhibition of, and rapid dissociation from DPP-8 and DPP-9, compared to DPP-4. In patients with type 2 diabetes, administration of vildagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. Vildagliptin inhibition of DPP-4 results in increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). The degree of improvement in beta-cell function is dependent on the initial degree of impairment; in non-diabetic (normal glycaemic) individuals, vildagliptin does not stimulate insulin secretion or reduce glucose levels. By increasing endogenous GLP-1 levels, vildagliptin enhances the sensitivity of alpha cells to glucose, resulting in reduced glucagon secretion. There is a reduction in inappropriate glucagon release during meals. The increase in the insulin/glucagon ratio with hyperglycaemia, due to increased incretin hormone levels, may thus be expected to decrease postprandial hepatic glucose production, leading to reduced glycaemia. The known effect of increased GLP-1 levels to delay gastric emptying is not observed with vildagliptin treatment. Clinical trials More than 15,000 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in double-blind, placebo- or active- controlled clinical trials including some studies of more than 2 years of treatment duration. In these studies, vildagliptin was administered to more than 9,000 patients at daily doses of 50 mg once daily, 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once daily. More than 5,000 male and more than 4,000 female patients received vildagliptin 50 mg once"}

More than 1,900 patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg once daily or 100 mg daily were ≥ 65 years of age. In these trials, vildagliptin was administered as monotherapy in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes or in combination in patients not adequately controlled by other antidiabetic medicinal products. Monotherapy studies suggested that vildagliptin on its own had slightly less efficacy compared to sulfonylureas or pioglitazone. The role of vildagliptin in dual therapy with 14 sulfonylureas and pioglitazone is incompletely defined. No morbidity or mortality data are available. Overall, vildagliptin improved glycaemic control when given as monotherapy or when used in combination with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione as measured by clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c from baseline at the study endpoint (see Table 10). Long-term extension studies with vildagliptin as add-on therapy to metformin, glimepiride, or pioglitazone generally demonstrated continued glycaemic benefit at week 52. However, results were variable across studies. Therefore, the individual long-term response may vary. In clinical trials, the magnitude of HbA1c reductions with vildagliptin was greater in patients with higher baseline HbA1c.

The composite endpoint of adjudicated major adverse cardio-vascular events (MACE) including acute myocardial infarction, stroke or CV death was similar for vildagliptin versus combined active and placebo comparators [risk ratio (RR) 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.61-1.11)] supporting the cardiovascular safety of vildagliptin. A MACE occurred in 83 out of 9,599 (0.86%) vildagliptin- treated patients and in 85 out of 7,102 (1.20%) comparator treated patients. Assessment of each individual MACE component showed no increased risk (similar RR). Confirmed heart failure events defined as heart failure requiring hospitalization or new onset of heart failure were reported in 41 (0.43%) vildagliptin-treated patients and 32 (0.45%) comparator-treated patients, with RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.68-1.70) showing no increased risk of heart failure in vildagliptin treated patients.

Fasting Plasma Glucose: When administered as monotherapy and add-on therapy, vildagliptin produced clinically relevant and consistent mean reductions from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations. 5.2 PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES Absorption Vildagliptin is rapidly absorbed with an absolute oral bioavailability of 85%. Peak plasma concentrations for vildagliptin and the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner over the therapeutic dose range. Following oral administration in the fasting state, vildagliptin is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations observed at 1.75 hours. Co-administration with food slightly decreases the rate of absorption of vildagliptin, as characterized by a 19% decrease in peak concentrations, and a delay in the time to peak plasma concentration to 2.5 hours. There is no change in the extent of absorption, and food does not alter the overall exposure (AUC). Distribution The plasma protein binding of vildagliptin is low (9.3%), and vildagliptin distributes equally between plasma and red blood cells. The mean volume of distribution of vildagliptin at steady state after intravenous administration (Vss) is 71 litres, suggesting extravascular distribution. Metabolism Metabolism is the major elimination pathway for vildagliptin in humans, accounting for 69% of the dose. The major metabolite, LAY151, is pharmacologically inactive and is the hydrolysis product of the cyano"}

Metabolism Metabolism is the major elimination pathway for vildagliptin in humans, accounting for 69% of the dose. The major metabolite, LAY151, is pharmacologically inactive and is the hydrolysis product of the cyano moiety, accounting for 57% of the dose, followed by the amide hydrolysis product (4% of the dose). DPP-4 contributes partially to the hydrolysis of vildagliptin as shown in an in-vivo study using DPP-4 deficient rats. Vildagliptin is not metabolized by cytochrome 21 P450 enzymes to any quantifiable extent. In-vitro studies demonstrated that vildagliptin does not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. Excretion Following oral administration of [14C] - vildagliptin, approximately 85% of the dose is excreted into the urine and 15% of the dose is recovered in the faeces. Renal excretion of unchanged vildagliptin accounts for 23% of the dose after oral administration. After intravenous administration to healthy subjects, the total plasma and renal clearances of vildagliptin are 41 litres/hour and 13 litres/hour, respectively. The mean elimination half-life after intravenous administration is approximately 2 hours. The elimination half-life after oral administration is approximately 3 hours and is independent of the dose. Special Populations Geriatric patients: In otherwise healthy elderly subjects (≥70 years), the overall exposure to vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) was increased by 32% with an 18% increase in peak plasma concentration compared to younger healthy subjects (18 to 40 years).

These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant. DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin is not affected by age in the age groups studied. Gender: No differences in the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin were observed between male and female subjects with a diverse range of age and body mass index (BMI). DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin was unaffected by gender. Paediatric patients: No pharmacokinetic data available. Obesity: BMI does not show any impact on the pharmacokinetic parameters of vildagliptin. DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin was unaffected by BMI. Hepatic Impairment: The effect of impaired hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin was studied in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment based on the Child-Pugh scores (ranging from 6 for mild to 12 for severe) in comparison to subjects with normal hepatic function. The exposure to vildagliptin (100 mg) after a single dose in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment was decreased (20% and 8%, respectively), while the exposure to vildagliptin for subjects with severe impairment was increased by 22%.

The use of vildagliptin is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment including patients with a pre-treatment ALT or AST > 2.5x the upper limit of normal (ULN). 22 Renal impairment: The AUC of vildagliptin increased on average 1.4, 1.7 and 2-fold in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to normal healthy subjects. The AUC of the metabolites LAY151 increased 1.6, 3.2 and 7.3-fold and that of BQS867 increased 1.4, 2.7 and 7.3-fold in patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to healthy volunteers. Limited data from patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) indicate that vildagliptin exposure is similar to that in patients with severe renal impairment. LAY151 concentrations in ESRD patients were approximately 2 to- 3-fold higher than in patients with severe renal impairment. Dosage adjustment may be required in patients with renal impairment (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration).

Race: There is no evidence that race affects the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin. 5.3 PRECLINICAL SAFETY DATA Genotoxicity Vildagliptin was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay and a human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay. Some clastogenic potential was exhibited in an in vitro micronucleus test in V79 Chinese hamster cells after long exposure to high, cytotoxic concentrations. However, no clastogenicity was observed in either mouse or rat micronucleus tests in vivo at up to ca 400 times the maximum human exposure, based on AUC. Furthermore, an in vivo mouse liver comet assay using the same dose was also negative. The weight of evidence indicates vildagliptin is unlikely to be genotoxic in humans at clinically relevant doses. Carcinogenicity Long-term oral studies with vildagliptin in rats and mice showed evidence of haemangiosarcomas at high exposures. Tumour incidence was increased at exposure levels 46- 235 times (mice) and 150 times (rats) human exposure at the maximum clinical dose, based on AUC. No significant increase in incidence was observed at 15 to 80 (females) times human exposure in mice. No effect levels of ca 80 to 160 times human exposure were established in rats. Mammary tumour incidence was increased in female mice at approximately 185 times the maximum anticipated human exposure to vildagliptin, but was not increased at ca 80 times.

The tumours are thought to result from species-specific hormonal disturbances. Based on the available data vildagliptin is not anticipated to present a carcinogenic risk at clinically relevant exposures. Effects on skin In a 13-week toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, skin lesions have been recorded at all oral doses administered (5 to 160 mg/kg/day). These were consistently located on the extremities (hands, feet, ears, scrotum and tail), and included flaking skin, peeling skin, scabs, tail sores and blisters. At 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to human AUC exposure at the 100 mg dose), lesions were reversible despite continued treatment. Necrotic lesions of the 23 tail were observed at ≥ 80 mg/kg/day (18 times human AUC exposure at the maximum recommended clinical dose). Skin lesions were not reversible in monkeys treated at 160 mg/kg/day (35 times human AUC exposure) during a 4-week recovery period. Skin lesions have not been observed in other animal species and no excess of skin lesions with vildagliptin treatment relative to comparator treatments have been observed in the human clinical trials programme. 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 LIST OF EXCIPIENTS Refer to Section 2 - Qualitative and quantitative composition. 6.2 INCOMPATIBILITIES Incompatibilities were either not assessed or not identified as part of the registration of this medicine. 6.3 SHELF LIFE In"}

Trajenta helps to improve the levels of insulin after a meal and lowers the amount of sugar made by your body. Lowering and controlling blood sugar may help prevent or delay complications of diabetes, such as heart disease, kidney disease, blindness and foot amputation. Along with diet and exercise, this medicine helps lower your blood sugar. Your doctor will prescribe Trajenta alone, or in combination with another anti-diabetic medicine if that medicine alone is not sufficient to control your blood sugar level. It is important that you continue to follow the diet and/or exercises recommended for you while you are on treatment with Trajenta. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason. This medicine is only available with a doctor's prescription. It is not addictive. Trajenta is used to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It may be used when diet plus exercise do not provide adequate blood sugar level control either: ⦁ ⦁ alone as a single medicine, or in combination with certain other anti-diabetic medicines such as: o metformin, or sulfonylurea medicines such as o glimepiride and glibenclamide, or insulin (with or without metformin), or metformin plus sulfonylurea medicines, or metformin plus sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitor medicines such as empagliflozin.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is also called non-insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus or NIDDM. Type 2 diabetes develops if the body does not make enough insulin, or if the insulin that your body makes does not work as well as it should. Insulin is a substance that helps to lower the level of sugar in your blood, especially after meals. When the level of sugar builds up in your blood, this can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to serious problems with your heart, brain, eyes, circulation, nerves or kidneys. 2.

In patients with inadequate glycaemic control with premixed or basal insulin (with or without metformin), the recommended dose of ONGLYZA is 5 mg once daily. Patients should be made aware of the potential risk of hypoglycaemia with a change in diabetes regime. ONGLYZA has not been studied in a regimen combining intermediate or long-acting insulin with mealtime bolus doses of short acting insulin (basal:bolus regimens) and its efficacy in this context has not been established. Evaluated experience with insulin is so far limited to 24 weeks of treatment (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties- Clinical Trials). Initial Combination Therapy The recommended starting doses of ONGLYZA and metformin when used as initial combination therapy is 5 mg ONGLYZA plus 500 mg metformin once daily.

ONGLYZA has not been studied in combination with GLP-1 agonists (e.g. exenatide, liraglutide). Hypersensitivity Reactions During postmarketing experience the following adverse reactions have been reported with use of saxagliptin: serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema.

Pancreatitis During postmarketing experience, there have been spontaneously reported adverse reactions of acute pancreatitis. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is suspected, ONGLYZA should be discontinued. (See section 4.8 Adverse effects (undesirable effects) – Postmarketing experience.) In the Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus- Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (SAVOR) Trial, the incidence of adjudicated pancreatitis events was 0.3% in both ONGLYZA treated patients and placebo-treated patients in the intent-to- treat population.

There is insufficient data to recommend use in patients with eGFR< 15 mL/min/1.73m2 or requiring either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. (See section 4.2 Dose and method of administration – Special Patient Populations (Use in Renal Impairment)). Skin disorders Ulcerative and necrotic skin lesions have been reported in extremities of monkeys in non-clinical toxicology studies. Although skin lesions were not observed at an increased incidence in clinical 3 of 34 trials, there is limited experience in patients with diabetic skin complications. Postmarketing reports of rash have been described in the DPP4 inhibitor class. Rash is also noted as an adverse event for saxagliptin (see section 4.8 Adverse effects (undesirable effects) – Postmarketing experience). Therefore, in keeping with routine care of the diabetic patient, monitoring for skin disorders, such as blistering, ulceration or rash, is recommended. Bullous pemphigoid Post-marketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalisation have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use.

Cardiac failure Experience in NYHA class III-IV is still limited. In the SAVOR trial a small increase in the rate for hospitalisation for heart failure was observed in the saxagliptin treated patients compared to placebo, although a causal relationship has not been established (See Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties – Clinical Trials (Cardiovascular Safety)). Additional analysis did not indicate a differential effect among NYHA classes. (See Section 4.8 Adverse effects (undesirable effects) - Adverse Reactions Associated with ONGLYZA in the SAVOR trial). Caution is warranted if ONGLYZA is used in patients who have known risk factors for hospitalization for heart failure, such as a history of heart failure or moderate to severe renal impairment. Patients should be advised of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure, and to immediately report such symptoms.

If a patient presents with severe joint pain, continuation of drug therapy should be individually assessed. (See Section 4.8 Adverse effects (undesirable effects) – Postmarketing experience). Immunocompromised patients Immunocompromised patients, such as patients who have undergone organ transplantation or patients diagnosed with human immunodeficiency syndrome, have not been studied in the saxagliptin clinical program. Therefore, the efficacy and safety profile of saxagliptin in these patients has not been established. Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycaemia The sulfonylurea class of antihyperglycaemic agents and insulin are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with ONGLYZA. (See Section 4.8 Adverse effects (undesirable effects).)

Effects on Laboratory tests No data available 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) which converts it to an active metabolite. Therefore, drugs which inhibit the activity of this enzyme system may increase plasma concentrations of saxagliptin but reduce those of its metabolite, whereas CYP3A inducers will tend to do the opposite. However, the overall biological effect of saxagliptin is unaffected by coadministration with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5. In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its major metabolite neither inhibited CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4, nor inhibited UGT1A9. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolised by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is neither a significant inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) nor an inducer of P-gp. The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its major metabolite in human serum is below measurable levels.

In studies conducted in healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin, and its major metabolite, were altered by some drugs which affect the CYP3A4/5 system. However, total exposure of the total active components of saxagliptin (parent + metabolite), was not meaningfully altered by metformin, glibenclamide, pioglitazone, digoxin, simvastatin, diltiazem, ketoconazole, rifampicin, omeprazole, aluminium hydroxide + magnesium hydroxide + simethicone combination, or famotidine. Saxagliptin also did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glibenclamide, pioglitazone, digoxin, simvastatin, diltiazem, ketoconazole or an estrogen/progestin contraceptive. Other interactions The effects of smoking, diet, herbal products, and alcohol use on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin have not been specifically studied. The safety and efficacy of saxagliptin in combination with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors or orlistat has not been established. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Effects on fertility In a rat fertility study, males were treated with oral gavage doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day for two weeks prior to mating, during mating, and up to scheduled termination (approximately four weeks total) and females were treated with oral gavage doses of 125, 300, and 750 mg/kg/day for two weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7.

Saxagliptin and/or its metabolites cross the placenta into the fetus following dosing in pregnant rats. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, ONGLYZA should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Use in lactation Saxagliptin and/or its metabolites are secreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether saxagliptin is secreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when ONGLYZA is administered to a nursing woman. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, when driving or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness has been reported with saxagliptin. 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects) Significant adverse events are also included in the Precautions sections.

For information on the management of overdose, contact the Poisons Information Centre on 131126 (Australia). 5 5.1 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Pharmacodynamic properties Mechanism of action Saxagliptin is a member of a class of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents called DPP-4 inhibitors. Saxagliptin is a reversible, competitive, DPP-4 inhibitor with nanomolar potency. Saxagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 versus other DPP enzymes, with greater than 75 fold selectivity over DPP-8 and DPP-9. Saxagliptin has extended binding to the DPP-4 active site, prolonging its inhibition of DPP-4. Saxagliptin exerts its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP- 1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Concentrations of these active intact incretin hormones are increased by saxagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the actions of 10 of 34 these hormones. Saxagliptin also inhibits the cleavage of other substrates in vitro, but the relevance or consequences of DPP4 inhibition for these substrates in patients is unknown. Incretin hormones are released by the intestine throughout the day and concentrations are increased in response"}

Saxagliptin also inhibits the cleavage of other substrates in vitro, but the relevance or consequences of DPP4 inhibition for these substrates in patients is unknown. Incretin hormones are released by the intestine throughout the day and concentrations are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are elevated GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. Concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes, but saxagliptin increases active GLP-1 and GIP, potentiating these mechanisms. By increasing and prolonging active incretin concentrations, saxagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon concentrations in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. ONGLYZA improves glycaemic control by reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes through improvements in alpha and beta cell function as reflected by the actions described below. Fasting glucose-dependent insulin secretion: ONGLYZA increases pancreatic beta-cell responsiveness to glucose in the fasting state and leads to enhanced insulin secretion and glucose disposal in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. Postprandial glucose-dependent insulin secretion: ONGLYZA increases pancreatic beta-cell responsiveness to glucose in the postprandial state and leads to enhanced postprandial insulin secretion and glucose disposal.

Postprandial glucose-dependent insulin secretion: ONGLYZA increases pancreatic beta-cell responsiveness to glucose in the postprandial state and leads to enhanced postprandial insulin secretion and glucose disposal. Postprandial glucagon secretion: In type 2 diabetes, paradoxical increases in glucagon secretion from alpha cells following meals stimulate hepatic glucose production and contribute to glycaemic dysregulation. ONGLYZA moderates glucagon secretion and lowers postprandial glucagon concentrations. Pharmacodynamics Improvement in Glycaemic Control In patients with type 2 diabetes, administration of ONGLYZA led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent beta-cell responsiveness, which resulted in higher insulin and C-peptide concentrations. The rise in insulin and the decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a clinical trial designed to study the effect of ONGLYZA on QTc interval, dosing with ONGLYZA was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8 times the Recommended Human Dose (RHD) of 5 mg/day).

Following the 40 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean changes in QTc interval and heart rate from baseline were 2.4 msec at 24 hours post-dose and 4.5 beats per minute at 4 hours post-dose, respectively. 11 of 34 Clinical trials Improved Glycaemic Control ONGLYZA has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin; glibenclamide; and the thiazolidinediones, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, an SGLT2 inhibitor and insulin. ONGLYZA has been studied with antidiabetic medicinal products as described below. ONGLYZA should be used as part of combination treatment with other diabetic agents. Results from long-term studies of ONGLYZA on overall morbidity and mortality outcomes are not available. There were 4148 patients with type 2 diabetes randomised, including 3021 patients treated with ONGLYZA, in six double-blind, controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of ONGLYZA on glycaemic control. In these studies, the mean age of patients was 54 years, and 71% of patients were white, 16% were Asian, 4% were black, and 9% were of other racial groups.

An additional 423 patients, including 315 who received ONGLYZA, participated in a placebo-controlled, dose- ranging study of six to twelve weeks in duration. In these six double-blind studies, ONGLYZA was evaluated at doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg once daily. Treatment with ONGLYZA at all doses produced clinically relevant and statistically significant improvements in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial glucose (PPG), including 2-hour PPG following standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), compared to control. Reductions in HbA1c were seen across subgroups including gender, age, race, and baseline BMI. Overall, the 10 mg daily dose of saxagliptin did not provide greater efficacy than the 5 mg daily dose. The ONGLYZA 5 mg daily dose generally provided greater reductions in HbA1c and PPG compared to the ONGLYZA 2.5 mg daily dose. ONGLYZA has been evaluated in six additional studies in patients with type 2 diabetes: an active- controlled study versus glipizide in 858 patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone, a placebo-controlled study with insulin in 455 type 2 diabetes patients inadequately controlled on a basal insulin (or insulin pre-mix) or a basal insulin"}

Significant reductions in 2-hour PPG level following standard oral glucose tolerance test were observed in the ONGLYZA 5 mg plus TZD treatment group (-3.6 mmol/L) compared with the placebo plus TZD group (-0.8 mmol/L). The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycaemic control or who were rescued for meeting pre-specified glycaemic criteria was 10% in the placebo plus TZD group and 6% for the 5 mg ONGLYZA plus TZD group. Higher baseline HbA1c was associated with a greater adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c with ONGLYZA 5 mg plus TZD. The effect of ONGLYZA plus TZD on lipid endpoints in this study 18 of 34 was similar to placebo. Small increases in body weight were observed in the ONGLYZA 5 mg plus TZD and placebo treatment groups (1.4 kg and 0.9 kg, respectively.)

Patients who received saxagliptin in the initial 12-week study period maintained the same dose of saxagliptin in the long-term extension. Most subjects (76%) in both treatment groups receiving insulin or other antihyperglycaemic medications had no change in dose or type of medication during the 52-week treatment period. In subjects who had a significant change in type or dose of insulin (more than +/− 20%) or OAD, efficacy data thereafter were excluded from the analysis. Treatment with saxagliptin 2.5 mg provided sustained improvement in HbA1c versus placebo (mean reduction from baseline at Week 52 of −1.4% for the saxagliptin group and −0.5% for the placebo group).

Saxagliptin was rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with maximum saxagliptin plasma concentrations (Cmax) usually attained within two hours after administration in the fasted state. The Cmax and AUC values increased proportionally to the increment in the saxagliptin dose. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC(INF) values for saxagliptin and its major metabolite were 78 ng·h/mL and 214 ng·h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma Cmax values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The intra-subject coefficients of variation for saxagliptin Cmax and AUC were less than 12%. Following a single oral dose of 5 mg saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half- life (t1/2) for saxagliptin was 2.5 hours, and the mean t1/2 value for plasma DPP-4 inhibition was 26.9 hours.

Following a single oral dose of 5 mg saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half- life (t1/2) for saxagliptin was 2.5 hours, and the mean t1/2 value for plasma DPP-4 inhibition was 26.9 hours. The inhibition of plasma DPP-4 activity by saxagliptin for at least 24 hours after oral administration of ONGLYZA is due to high potency, high affinity, and extended binding to the active site. No appreciable accumulation was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence was observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its major metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 400 mg. Results from population-based exposure modelling indicate that the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its major metabolite were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. Absorption Based on food effects studies, ONGLYZA may be administered with or without food. However, in pivotal efficacy and safety studies ONGLYZA was generally taken prior to the morning meal. The amount of saxagliptin absorbed following an oral dose is at least 75%. The absolute oral bioavailability of saxagliptin is approximately 50% (90% CI of 48-53%). Food had relatively modest effects on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin in healthy subjects.

The time for saxagliptin to reach Cmax (Tmax) was increased by approximately 0.5 hours with food compared with the fasted state. These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful. Distribution The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its major metabolite in human serum is below measurable levels. Thus, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (eg, renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Metabolism The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a reversible, competitive DPP-4 inhibitor, half as potent as saxagliptin. It also demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 versus other DPP enzymes, with greater than 163 fold selectivity over DPP-8 and DPP-9. Excretion Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its major metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion.

A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Pharmacokinetics of the Major Metabolite The Cmax and AUC values for the major metabolite of saxagliptin increased proportionally to the increment in the saxagliptin dose. Following single oral doses of 2.5 mg to 400 mg saxagliptin in the fed or fasted states, the mean AUC values for the major metabolite ranged from 2-7 times higher than the parent saxagliptin exposures on a molar basis. Following a single oral dose of 5 mg saxagliptin in the fasted state, the mean terminal half-life (t1/2) value for the major metabolite was 3.1 hours and no appreciable accumulation was observed upon repeated once-daily dosing at any dose. Special Populations Renal Impairment A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function.

In subjects with CrCL>50 mL/min (approximately corresponding to eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 by Modified Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] eGFR equation, following post-hoc re-analysis) the AUC values of saxagliptin and its major metabolite were 1.2- and 1.7-fold higher, respectively, than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function.

Hepatic Impairment There were no clinically meaningful differences in pharmacokinetics for subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, no dosage adjustment for ONGLYZA is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. In subjects with hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh classes A, B, and C), mean Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin were up to 8% and 77% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 10 mg dose of saxagliptin.

BMI was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its major metabolite in an exposure modelling analysis. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Genotoxicity The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of saxagliptin was tested at high concentrations and exposures in a battery of genetic toxicity studies including an in vitro Ames bacterial assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in primary human lymphocytes, an in vivo oral micronucleus assay in rats, an in vivo oral DNA repair study in rats, and an oral in vivo/in vitro cytogenetics study in rat peripheral blood lymphocytes. Saxagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic based on the combined outcomes of these studies. The major metabolite was not mutagenic in an in vitro Ames bacterial assay. Carcinogenicity Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Saxagliptin did not induce tumours in mice treated at up to 600 mg/kg/day, producing exposure 1123-times that of humans at the recommended clinical dose.

Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been observed in patients taking linagliptin. If pancreatitis is suspected, TRAJENTA should be discontinued. TRAJENTA PI0137-11 Page 1 of 16 Hypoglycaemia Linagliptin alone showed a comparable incidence of hypoglycaemia to placebo. In clinical trials of linagliptin as part of combination therapy with agents not known to cause hypoglycaemia (metformin), rates of hypoglycaemia reported with linagliptin were similar to rates in patients taking placebo. Sulfonylureas and insulin are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, caution is advised when linagliptin is used in combination with a sulfonylurea and/or insulin. A dose reduction of the sulfonylurea or insulin may be considered. Bullous pemphigoid Bullous pemphigoid has been observed in patients taking linagliptin.

It is not an inducer of CYP isozymes. Linagliptin inhibits P-glycoprotein mediated transport of digoxin with low potency. Based on this result and in vivo drug interaction studies, linagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other P-glycoprotein substrates. However, as linagliptin is a P-glycoprotein substrate, inhibitors/inducers of this transporter may affect linagliptin plasma kinetics. TRAJENTA PI0137-11 Page 2 of 16 In vivo assessment of drug interactions Clinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions by co-administered medicinal products is low. No clinically significant interactions requiring dose adjustment were observed. Linagliptin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glibenclamide, simvastatin, pioglitazone, warfarin, digoxin or oral contraceptives providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, P-glycoprotein, and organic cationic transporter (OCT). Metformin: Co-administration of multiple three-times-daily doses of 850 mg metformin with a supratherapeutic dose of 10 mg linagliptin once daily did not clinical meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin or metformin in healthy volunteers. Therefore, linagliptin is not an inhibitor of OCT-mediated transport. Sulfonylureas: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of 5 mg linagliptin were not changed by co-administration administration of a single 1.75 mg dose glibenclamide (glyburide) and multiple oral doses of 5 mg linagliptin. However, there was a clinically not relevant reduction of 14% of both AUC and Cmax of glibenclamide. Because glibenclamide is primarily"}
{"source_url": "data\\downloads\\CP-2011-PI-03485-3.pdf", "title": "CP-2011-PI-03485-3.pdf", "section": "section-5", "drug_name": "Trajenta", "active_ingridients": ["Linagliptin"], "text": "The steady-state pharmacokinetics of 5 mg linagliptin were not changed by co-administration administration of a single 1.75 mg dose glibenclamide (glyburide) and multiple oral doses of 5 mg linagliptin. However, there was a clinically not relevant reduction of 14% of both AUC and Cmax of glibenclamide. Because glibenclamide is primarily metabolised by CYP2C9, these data also support the conclusion that linagliptin is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor. Clinically meaningful interactions would not be expected with other sulfonylureas (e.g. glipizide, tolbutamide and glimepiride) which, like glibenclamide, are primarily eliminated by CYP2C9. Ritonavir: A study was conducted to assess the effect of ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin. Co-administration of a single 5 mg oral dose of linagliptin and multiple 200 mg oral doses of ritonavir increased the AUC and Cmax of linagliptin approximately respectively. Simulations of steady-state plasma concentrations of linagliptin with and without ritonavir indicated that the increase in exposure will not be associated with an increased accumulation. These changes in linagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions would not be expected with other P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 inhibitors and dose adjustment is not required. two-fold and three-fold, Rifampicin: A study was conducted to assess the effect of rifampicin, a potent inductor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, on the pharmacokinetics of 5 mg linagliptin. Multiple co-administration of linagliptin with rifampicin, resulted in a 39.6% and 43.8% decreased linagliptin steady-state AUC and Cmax and about 30% decreased DPP-4 inhibition at trough."}

Multiple co-administration of linagliptin with rifampicin, resulted in a 39.6% and 43.8% decreased linagliptin steady-state AUC and Cmax and about 30% decreased DPP-4 inhibition at trough. Thus linagliptin in combination with strong P-glycoprotein inducers is expected to be clinically efficacious, although full efficacy might not be achieved. Digoxin: Co-administration of multiple of 5 mg linagliptin with multiple doses of 0.25 mg digoxin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in healthy volunteers. Therefore, linagliptin is not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein-mediated transport in vivo. Warfarin: Multiple daily doses of 5 mg linagliptin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of S(-) or R(+) warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, showing that linagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Simvastatin: Multiple daily doses of 10 mg linagliptin (supratherapeutic) had a minimal effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, in healthy volunteers. Following administration of 10 mg linagliptin concomitantly with 40 mg of simvastatin daily for 6 days, the plasma AUC of simvastatin was increased by 34%, and the plasma Cmax by 10%. Therefore, linagliptin is considered to be a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism, and dosage adjustment of concomitantly administered substances metabolised by CYP3A4 is considered unnecessary. Oral Contraceptives: Co-administration with 5 mg linagliptin did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel or ethinylestradiol. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on Fertility No studies on the"}

No adverse effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats given linagliptin orally up to the highest dose of 240 mg/kg/day (yielding approximately 1000 times the plasma AUC obtained in patients at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 5 mg/day prior to and throughout mating. TRAJENTA PI0137-11 Page 3 of 16 Use in Pregnancy (Category B3) There are limited data from the use of linagliptin in pregnant women. Linagliptin was shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits. In animal embryofetal development studies, linagliptin was shown to be not teratogenic in rats at oral doses up to 240 mg/kg/day (approximately 1000 times the exposure in patients at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC) and up to 150 mg/kg/day in the rabbit (approximately 2000 times human exposure). However, postimplantation loss was increased in both species at these upper dose levels (together with maternotoxicity), and there was an increase in runts and a slight increase in the incidence of fetal visceral variations in the rabbit. No adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed at up to 30 mg/kg/day in the rat (50 times human exposure) and up to 25"}

No adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed at up to 30 mg/kg/day in the rat (50 times human exposure) and up to 25 mg/kg/day in the rabbit (78 times human exposure). However, as animal studies are not always predictive of human response, as a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of TRAJENTA during pregnancy. Use in Lactation Linagliptin and its metabolites were shown to be readily excreted in the milk of lactating rats. A risk to the newborns / infants cannot be excluded. TRAJENTA should not be used during breast-feeding. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. If patients experience dizziness, they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery. 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Reporting suspected adverse effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions at www.tga.gov.au/reporting- problems. Adverse Events in Clinical Trials The safety of TRAJENTA has been evaluated overall in 11,341 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus of which 10,694 patients received the target dose of 5 mg.

In placebo-controlled studies, 10,963 patients were included and 6,580 patients were treated with the therapeutic dose of 5 mg linagliptin. 6,061 patients were exposed to linagliptin 5 mg once daily for ≥ 12 weeks. In the pooled analysis of the placebo-controlled trials, the overall incidence of adverse events in patients treated with placebo was similar to linagliptin 5 mg (63.4% versus 59.1%). Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was higher in patients who received placebo as compared to linagliptin 5 mg (4.3% versus 3.4%). Due to the impact of the background therapy on adverse events (e.g. on hypoglycaemias), adverse events were analysed based on the respective treatment regimens (monotherapy, add on to metformin, add on to sulfonylurea, add on to metformin plus sulfonylurea, add on to insulin, and add on to metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors). TRAJENTA 5 mg once daily was studied as monotherapy in two placebo-controlled trials of 18- and 24 weeks duration. Seven placebo-controlled studies investigated linagliptin in combination with other anti-glycaemic agents: two with metformin (12- and 24-weeks treatment duration); one with a sulfonylurea (18-weeks treatment duration); one with metformin and sulfonylurea (24-week treatment duration); one with insulin (primary endpoint at 24 weeks); and one with metformin and empagliflozin (24-weeks).

TRAJENTA PI0137-11 Page 7 of 16 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Pharmacotherapeutic group: DPP-4 inhibitor, ATC code: A10BH05 Mechanism of action Linagliptin is an inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 (Dipeptidyl peptidase 4), an enzyme which is involved in the inactivation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP (glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose- dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). These hormones are rapidly degraded by the enzyme DPP- 4. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretins are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Linagliptin binding to DPP-4 is reversible but long lasting and thus leads to a sustained increase and a prolongation of active incretin levels. In vitro, linagliptin inhibits DPP-4 with nanomolar potency and exhibits a >10000 fold selectivity versus DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity. Clinical trials Eight phase III randomised controlled trials involving 5,239 patients with type 2 diabetes, of which 3,319 were treated with linagliptin were conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety.

After oral administration of a 5 mg dose to healthy volunteer patients, linagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1.5 hours post-dose. TRAJENTA PI0137-11 Page 12 of 16 linagliptin, Plasma concentrations of linagliptin decline in a triphasic manner with a long terminal half-life (terminal half-life for linagliptin more than 100 hours), that is mostly related to the saturable, tight binding of linagliptin to DPP-4 and does not contribute to the accumulation of the drug. The effective half-life for accumulation of linagliptin, as determined from oral administration of multiple doses of 5 mg is approximately 12 hours. After once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of 5 mg linagliptin are reached by the third dose. Plasma area under the curve (AUC) of linagliptin increased approximately 33% following 5 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for linagliptin AUC were small (12.6% and 28.5%, respectively). Plasma AUC of linagliptin increased in a less than dose- proportional"}

The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for linagliptin AUC were small (12.6% and 28.5%, respectively). Plasma AUC of linagliptin increased in a less than dose- proportional manner. The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of linagliptin is approximately 30%. Because co-administration of a high- fat meal with linagliptin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics, linagliptin may be administered with or without food. In vitro studies indicated that linagliptin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and of CYP3A4. Ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, led to a two-fold increase in exposure (AUC) and multiple co-administration of linagliptin with rifampicin, a potent inducer of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A, resulted in an approximate 40% decreased linagliptin steady-state AUC, presumably by increasing/decreasing the bioavailability of linagliptin by inhibition/induction of P-glycoprotein. Distribution As a result of tissue binding, the mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state following a single 5 mg intravenous dose of linagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 1110 litres, indicating that linagliptin extensively distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is concentration-dependent, decreasing from about 99% at 1 nmol/L to 75-89% at ≥ 30 nmol/L, reflecting saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin. At the peak plasma concentration in humans at 5 mg/day, approximately 10% of"}

Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is concentration-dependent, decreasing from about 99% at 1 nmol/L to 75-89% at ≥ 30 nmol/L, reflecting saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin. At the peak plasma concentration in humans at 5 mg/day, approximately 10% of linagliptin is unbound. Metabolism Following a [14C]-linagliptin oral 10 mg dose, approximately 5% of the radioactivity was excreted in urine. Metabolism plays a subordinate role in the elimination of linagliptin. One main metabolite with a relative exposure of 13.3% of linagliptin at steady state was detected and was found to be pharmacologically inactive and thus does not contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of linagliptin. Excretion Following administration of an oral [14C]-linagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 85% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (80%) or urine (5%) within 4 days of dosing. Renal clearance at steady state was approximately 70 mL/min. Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups: Pharmacokinetics in the elderly: No dosage adjustment is required based on age, as age did not have a clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase II data.

In addition the pharmacokinetic characteristics of linagliptin were found to be similar in dedicated phase I studies in Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian healthy volunteers and African American type 2 diabetes patients. Pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment: A multiple-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin (5 mg dose) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to normal healthy control subjects. The study included patients with renal impairment classified on the basis of creatinine clearance as mild (50 to < 80 mL/min), moderate (30 to < 50 mL/min), and severe (< 30 mL/min), as well as patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis.

In addition, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment (< 30 mL/min) were compared to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. Creatinine clearance was measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance measurements or estimated from serum creatinine based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula: CrCl = [140 - age (years)] x weight (kg) {x 0.85 for female patients} / [72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)]. Under steady-state conditions, linagliptin exposure in patients with mild renal impairment was comparable to healthy subjects. In moderate renal impairment, a moderate increase in exposure of about 1.7 fold was observed compared with control. Exposure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment was increased by about 1.4 fold compared to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. Steady-state predictions for AUC of linagliptin in patients with ESRD indicated comparable exposure to that of patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.

Pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment: In patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment (according to the Child-Pugh classification), mean AUC and Cmax of linagliptin were similar to healthy matched controls following administration of multiple 5 mg doses of linagliptin. No dosage adjustment for linagliptin is necessary for patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.3 PRECLINICAL SAFETY DATA Genotoxicity Linagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, and an in vivo micronucleus assay in the rat. Carcinogenicity No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed with linagliptin in 2-year studies in mice and rats given oral doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses correspond to approximately 300- and 400-times the human exposure (plasma AUC) at the MRHD of 5 mg/day. 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 LIST OF EXCIPIENTS Each TRAJENTA tablet contains pregelatinised maize starch, maize starch, mannitol, copovidone, magnesium stearate and the colouring agent Opadry Pink 02F34337. 6.2 INCOMPATIBILITIES Incompatibilities were either not assessed or not identified as part of the registration of this medicine.

Chronic kidney disease The recommended dose of FORXIGA is 10 mg taken orally once daily at any time of the day regardless of meals. Special populations Renal impairment No dose adjustment is required based on renal function. Initiating treatment with FORXIGA in patients with eGFR <25 mL/min/1.73 m2 is not recommended (see section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use).

Elderly No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age (see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties). 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE FORXIGA should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes (see section 4.1 Therapeutic Indications) or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (see section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use – Ketoacidosis). Use in renal impairment There is limited experience with initiating treatment with FORXIGA in patients eGFR <25 mL/min/1.73 m2. Dapagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR (see 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating dapagliflozin. Patients with hypovolaemia may be more susceptible to these changes. The glucose lowering efficacy of dapagliflozin is dependent on renal function and is reduced where eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2.

FORXIGA should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2 Dose and method of administration and section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties– Special Populations). Use in Patients at Risk for Volume depletion and or hypotension The diuretic effect of FORXIGA is a potential concern for volume depleted patients. Due to its mechanism of action, FORXIGA induces osmotic diuresis which may lead to the modest decrease in blood pressure observed in clinical studies (see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties – Clinical trials). 3(63) When considering initiating dapagliflozin, there may be patients for whom the additional diuretic effect of dapagliflozin is a potential concern either due to acute illness (such as gastrointestinal illness) or a history of hypotension or dehydration with diuretic therapy for patients who may become volume depleted. Initiation of therapy with dapagliflozin is therefore not recommended in these patients. In case of intercurrent conditions that may lead to volume depletion, such as gastrointestinal illness, heat stress or severe infections, careful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including electrolytes) is recommended. Temporary interruption of FORXIGA is recommended for patients who develop volume depletion until the depletion is corrected (see section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Caution should be exercised in"}

Temporary interruption of FORXIGA is recommended for patients who develop volume depletion until the depletion is corrected (see section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Caution should be exercised in patients for whom a dapagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could pose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on antihypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension or elderly patients. Ketoacidosis in patients with diabetes mellitus FORXIGA should not be used for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). There have been reports of ketoacidosis, including DKA, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalisation in patients taking dapagliflozin and other sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking dapagliflozin. Patients treated with FORXIGA who present with signs and symptoms consistent with ketoacidosis, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise and shortness of breath, should be assessed for ketoacidosis, even if blood glucose levels are below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). If ketoacidosis is suspected, FORXIGA should be suspended, the patient should be evaluated and prompt treatment initiated. Treatment of ketoacidosis generally requires insulin, fluid, potassium and carbohydrate replacement. Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is not recommended unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved. Before initiating FORXIGA, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis. Factors that predispose patients to ketoacidosis"}

Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is not recommended unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved. Before initiating FORXIGA, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis. Factors that predispose patients to ketoacidosis include insulin deficiency from any cause (including insulin pump failure, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), insulin dose reduction, reduced caloric intake or increased insulin requirements due to infections, low carbohydrate diet, acute illness, surgery, a previous ketoacidosis, dehydration and alcohol abuse. FORXIGA should be used with caution in these patients. Consider monitoring patients for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing FORXIGA in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. 4(63) Surgery Treatment with FORXIGA should be ceased prior to major surgery. An increase in other glucose lowering agents may be required during this time. Patients scheduled for non-urgent surgery who have not ceased dapagliflozin should be assessed and consideration should be given to postponing the procedure. Treatment with FORXIGA may be restarted once the patient’s condition has stabilised and oral intake is normal. Urinary Tract Infections There have been post-marketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalisation in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FORXIGA. Urinary tract infections were more frequently reported for dapagliflozin 10 mg compared to control in a placebo-pooled analysis up to 24 weeks (4.7% vs. 3.5%, respectively).

Urinary tract infections were more frequently reported for dapagliflozin 10 mg compared to control in a placebo-pooled analysis up to 24 weeks (4.7% vs. 3.5%, respectively). Urinary glucose excretion may be associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (see section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Temporary interruption of dapagliflozin should be considered when treating pyelonephritis or urosepsis. Discontinuation of dapagliflozin may be considered in cases of recurrent urinary tract infections; see section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects). Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene) Post-marketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier’s gangrene), a rare, but serious and potentially life-threatening necrotising infection, have been reported in female and male patients with diabetes mellitus treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin (see section 4.8 (Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Serious outcomes have included hospitalisation, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with FORXIGA who present with pain or tenderness, erythema, swelling in the genital or perineal area, fever, malaise should be evaluated for necrotising fasciitis. If suspected, FORXIGA should be discontinued and prompt treatment should be instituted (including broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement if necessary).

It is important to regularly examine the feet and counsel all patients with diabetes on routine preventative footcare. Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycaemia Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or the insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with FORXIGA (see section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). 5(63) Paediatric use Safety and effectiveness of FORXIGA in paediatric patients have not been established. Delayed growth and metabolic acidosis in rats were observed in both sexes at higher doses (greater than or equal to 15 mg/kg/day). The developmental age of animals in this study approximately correlates to 2 to 16 years in humans. Use in the elderly No dosage adjustment for FORXIGA is required based on age (see Section 4.2 Dose and administration). Older patients are more likely to have impaired renal function. The renal function recommendations provided for all patients also apply to elderly patients (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use).

The major metabolite, dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, is not an SGLT2 inhibitor. In in-vitro studies, dapagliflozin neither inhibited CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, 2B6 or 3A4. Therefore, dapagliflozin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes and drugs which inhibit or induce these enzymes are not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin is a weak substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) active transporter and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is a substrate for the OAT3 active transporter. Dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide did not meaningfully inhibit P- gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 active transporters. Overall, dapagliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered medications that are P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 substrates. 7(63) In interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly single dose design, the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin were not altered by metformin (an hOCT-1 and hOCT-2 substrate), pioglitazone (a CYP2C8 [major] and CYP3A4 [minor] substrate), sitagliptin (an hOAT-3 substrate, and P-glycoprotein substrate), glimepiride (a CYP2C9 substrate), voglibose, hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, or simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate). Therefore, meaningful interaction of dapagliflozin with other substrates of hOCT-1, hOCT-2, hOAT-3, P-gp, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and other α-glucosidase inhibitors would not be expected.

Therefore, meaningful interaction of dapagliflozin with other substrates of hOCT-1, hOCT-2, hOAT-3, P-gp, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and other α-glucosidase inhibitors would not be expected. Concomitant use of dapagliflozin and lithium may lead to a reduction in serum lithium concentrations due to a possible increased urinary clearance of lithium. The dose of lithium may need to be adjusted. Dapagliflozin also did not alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepiride, hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, simvastatin, digoxin (a P-gp substrate), or warfarin (S-warfarin is a CYP2C substrate). Therefore, dapagliflozin is not a clinical meaningful inhibitor of hOCT-1, hOCT-2, hOAT-3, P-gp transporter pathway, and CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 mediated metabolism. Following coadministration of dapagliflozin with rifampicin (an inducer of various active transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes) or mefenamic acid (an inhibitor of UGT1A9), a 22% decrease and a 51% increase, respectively, in dapagliflozin systemic exposure was seen, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24-hour urinary glucose excretion in either case. No dose adjustment of dapagliflozin is recommended when dapagliflozin is coadministered with either rifampicin or mefenamic acid. Other Interactions The effects of smoking, diet, herbal products, and alcohol use on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin have not been specifically studied. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on fertility In a study of fertility in rats, no effects on mating, fertility, or early embryonic development were seen when males received oral doses"}

However, at 210 mg/kg/day, a dose associated with profound toxicity (including mortality), seminal vesicle and epididymal weights were reduced; sperm motility and sperm counts were reduced; and there were increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm. No adverse effects on sperm or male reproductive organs were seen at 75 mg/kg/day (700 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD). Use in pregnancy – Category D There are no data from the use of dapagliflozin in pregnant women. Studies in rats have shown toxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to the second and third trimesters of human pregnancy (see section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for 8(63) use). Therefore, FORXIGA must not be used during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. When pregnancy is detected, treatment with FORXIGA should be discontinued.

An increased incidence of embryofoetal lethality, decreased foetal weight and an increased incidence of foetal visceral and skeletal anomalies were seen in rats at maternotoxic doses (oral doses greater than or equal to 150 mg/kg/day). The no observed effect level for embryofoetal effects in rats was an oral dose of 75 mg/kg/day (1530 times the exposure in patients at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). No developmental toxicities were observed in rabbits at oral doses up to 180 mg/kg/day (1265 times the exposure in patients at the MRHD). Use in lactation FORXIGA must not be used by breastfeeding women. It is not known whether dapagliflozin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Studies in rats have shown excretion of dapagliflozin in milk. Direct and indirect exposure of dapagliflozin to weanling juvenile rats and during late pregnancy are each associated with increased incidence and/or severity of renal pelvic and tubular dilatations in progeny. The long-term functional consequences of these effects are unknown. These periods of exposure coincide with a critical window of renal maturation in rats.

Additionally, the negative effects on body weight gain associated with lactational exposure in weanling juvenile rats suggest that FORXIGA must be avoided during the first 2 years of life. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when dapagliflozin is used in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin. 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Significant adverse events are also described in the section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use section.

In the analysis of pooled safety data of 1169 patients from trials evaluating saxagliptin in combination with dapagliflozin at 24 weeks, the overall incidence of hypoglycaemia for the pooled safety data of was low (≤1.8% in any treatment group); there was no increase in hypoglycaemia in saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus metformin treatment group compared to the saxagliptin plus metformin or dapagliflozin plus metformin treatment groups. The combined use of saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin plus metformin was not associated with an increase in the risk of hypoglycaemia when compared to the individual agents as monotherapy. This was consistent with prior clinical trial experience regardless of whether the combination was added to metformin concurrently or sequentially. In a study of FORXIGA 10 mg initiated concomitantly with extended release exenatide (on a background of metformin), there were no episodes of major or minor hypoglycaemia reported.

Inhibition of SGLT2 by dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate in the proximal renal tubule with a concomitant reduction in sodium reabsorption leading to urinary excretion of glucose and osmotic diuresis. Dapagliflozin therefore increases the delivery of"}

Inhibition of SGLT2 by dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate in the proximal renal tubule with a concomitant reduction in sodium reabsorption leading to urinary excretion of glucose and osmotic diuresis. Dapagliflozin therefore increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule which increases tubuloglomerular feedback and reduces intraglomerular pressure. This combined with osmotic diuresis leads to a reduction in volume overload, reduced blood pressure, and lower preload and afterload, which may have beneficial effects on cardiac remodelling and preserve renal function. Other effects include an increase in haematocrit and reduction in body weight. The cardio-renal benefits of dapagliflozin are not solely dependent on the blood glucose- lowering effect and not limited to patients with diabetes. In addition to the osmotic diuretic and related hemodynamic actions of SGLT2 inhibition, potential secondary effects on myocardial metabolism, ion channels, fibrosis, adipokines and uric acid may be mechanisms underlying the cardio-renal beneficial effects of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin improves both fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and post-prandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels by reducing renal glucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion. This glucose excretion (glucuretic effect) is observed after the first dose, is continuous over the 24 hour dosing interval, and is sustained for the duration of treatment.

The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this mechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and GFR. Thus, in subjects with normal blood glucose and/or low eGFR, dapagliflozin has a low propensity to cause hypoglycaemia, as the amount of filtrated glucose is small and can be reabsorbed by SGLT1 and unblocked SGLT2 transporters. Dapagliflozin does not impair normal endogenous glucose production in response to hypoglycaemia. Dapagliflozin acts independently of insulin secretion and insulin action. Over time, improvement in beta cell function (HOMA-2) has been observed in clinical studies with dapagliflozin. The majority of the weight reduction was body fat loss, including visceral fat rather than lean tissue or fluid loss as demonstrated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and magnetic resonance imaging. SGLT2 is selectively expressed in the kidney. Dapagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters important for glucose transport into peripheral tissues and is approximately 1000-3000 times more selective for SGLT2 vs. SGLT1, the major transporter in the gut responsible for glucose absorption. 18(63) Pharmacodynamic effects Increases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin. Approximately 70 g of glucose was excreted in the urine per day (corresponding to 280 kcal/day) at a dapagliflozin dose of 10 mg/day in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks.

Evidence of sustained glucose excretion was seen in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus given dapagliflozin 10mg/day for up to 2 years. This urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in osmotic diuresis and increases in urinary volume. Urinary volume increases in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with FORXIGA 10 mg were sustained at 12 weeks and amounted to approximately 375 mL/day. The increase in urinary volume was associated with a small and transient increase in urinary sodium excretion that was not associated with changes in serum sodium concentrations. Urinary uric acid excretion was also increased transiently (for 3-7 days) and accompanied by a reduction in serum uric acid concentration. At 24 weeks, reductions in serum uric acid concentrations ranged from 18.3 to 48.3 μmol/L.

Maximum dapagliflozin plasma concentrations (Cmax) were usually attained within 2 hours after administration in the fasted state. The Cmax and AUC values increased proportional to the increment in dapagliflozin dose. The absolute oral 58(63) bioavailability of dapagliflozin following the administration of a 10 mg dose is 78%. Food had relatively modest effects on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects.

Administration with a high-fat meal decreased dapagliflozin Cmax by up to 50% and prolonged Tmax by approximately 1 hour, but did not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Distribution Dapagliflozin is approximately 91% protein bound. Protein binding was not altered in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment). Metabolism Dapagliflozin is extensively metabolized, primarily to yield dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, with a molar plasma AUC 52% higher than that of dapagliflozin itself at the clinical dose, is an inactive metabolite and does not contribute to the glucose lowering effects. The formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is mediated by UGT1A9, an enzyme present in the liver and kidney, and CYP mediated metabolism was a minor clearance pathway in humans. Excretion Dapagliflozin and related metabolites are primarily eliminated via urinary excretion, of which less than 2% is unchanged dapagliflozin. After oral administration of 50 mg [14C]-dapagliflozin dose, 96% was recovered, 75% in urine and 21% in faeces. In faeces, approximately 15% of the dose was excreted as parent drug. The mean plasma terminal half- life (t1/2) for dapagliflozin was 12.9 hours following a single oral dose of FORXIGA 10 mg to healthy subjects.

Renal Impairment At steady-state (20 mg once-daily dapagliflozin for 7 days), patients with type 2 diabetes and mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (as determined by iohexol clearance) had mean systemic exposures of dapagliflozin that were 32%, 60% and 87% higher, respectively, than those of patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function. At dapagliflozin 20 mg once-daily, higher systemic exposure to dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal impairment did not result in a correspondingly higher renal glucose clearance or 24 hour glucose excretion. The renal glucose clearance and 24 hour glucose excretion was lower in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment as compared to patients with normal and mild renal impairment. The steady-state 24-h urinary glucose excretion was highly dependent on renal function and 85, 52, 18 and 11 g of glucose/day was excreted by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function or mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, respectively.

FORXIGA is also used with other medicines to treat heart failure and to slow the progression of kidney disease in adults. Type 2 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus (also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or NIDDM) is the condition of having high levels of blood sugar (hyperglycaemia). This is usually because your body does not make enough insulin and/or the insulin that your body produces does not work as well as it should. Left uncontrolled, the build-up of high levels of sugar in your blood can lead to serious medical problems. The main goal of treating type 2 diabetes is to control your blood sugar to a normal level.

FORXIGA by itself is unlikely to cause low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) because it does not interfere with the insulin hormone that regulates blood sugar. • Heart failure Heart failure occurs when the heart is weak and cannot pump enough blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.

Nesina is used when your blood sugar cannot be adequately controlled by diet, exercise and one or more of these other antidiabetic medicines. It is important that you continue to take your other antidiabetic medication and continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise that your doctor or diabetes educator has given you. Type 2 Diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes is also called non- insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Type 2 diabetes develops if the body does not make enough insulin, or if the insulin that your body makes does not work as well as it should. It can also develop if the body produces too much glucagon. Insulin is a hormone which helps lower the level of sugar in your blood, especially after meals. Glucagon is another hormone which triggers the production of sugar by the liver, causing the blood sugar to rise. The pancreas makes both of these hormones. If your blood glucose is not properly controlled, you may experience hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) or hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose). High blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, circulation and/or kidneys. The main goal of treating diabetes is to lower your blood sugar to a level deemed appropriate by your doctor. Lowering and controlling blood sugar may help prevent or"}

High blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, circulation and/or kidneys. The main goal of treating diabetes is to lower your blood sugar to a level deemed appropriate by your doctor. Lowering and controlling blood sugar may help prevent or delay complications of diabetes. How Nesina works Nesina contains the active ingredient alogliptin, which is a member of a class of medicines you take by mouth called DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors), that lowers blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. • Nesina lowers blood sugar when blood sugar is high, especially after a meal. • Nesina helps improve the levels of insulin produced by your own body after a meal. • Nesina decreases the amount of blood sugar made by the body. • Nesina by itself is unlikely to cause low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) because it does not work when blood sugar is low. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about why it has been prescribed for you. This medicine is only available with a doctor’s prescription. This medicine is not addictive. 1 Before you take it When you must not take it Do not take Nesina if you are allergic to alogliptin (the active ingredient in Nesina) or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet.

When NESINA is used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue such as a sulfonylurea, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be considered to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. The combination of insulin and alogliptin has not been specifically studied in T2DM patients with moderate or severe renal failure. Caution is therefore required regarding risk of hypoglycaemia in this circumstance. The safety and efficacy of NESINA when used as triple therapy with metformin and a sulphonylurea have not been fully established.

For patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥30 to ≤50 mL/min), the recommended dose of NESINA is 12.5 mg once daily. For patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) or End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, the recommended dose of NESINA is 6.25 mg once daily. NESINA may be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis. Experience in patients requiring renal dialysis is limited. Alogliptin has not been studied in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties, Special Populations, Renal Impairment). Appropriate assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of NESINA and periodically thereafter. Elderly (≥ 65 years old) No dose adjustment is necessary based on age. However, dosing of NESINA should be conservative in patients with advanced age due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population (see also Section 4.2 Dose and Method of Administration, Renal Impairment).

NESINA PI V7.0 (CCDS 6.0) 2 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE General NESINA should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Use with other antihyperglycaemic medications and hypoglycaemia Clinical trials of NESINA alone or as add-on therapy to metformin or a thiazolidinedione demonstrated that there was no clinically relevant increase in hypoglycaemia rate compared to placebo. In a clinical trial of NESINA as add-on therapy to a sulphonylurea, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower than that of placebo. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was greater in studies of NESINA as add-on therapy to metformin with a thiazolidinedione and as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin) compared to active-control or placebo, respectively [see Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects)]. Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with alogliptin (see Section 4.2 Dose and Method of Administration). Cardiac failure There is limited experience of alogliptin use in clinical trials in patients with congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV.

NESINA should, therefore, be used with caution in these patients [see Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects)]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Postmarketing events of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with alogliptin such as angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported and have been associated with other DPP-4 inhibitors. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, alogliptin should be discontinued. Acute Pancreatitis Postmarketing events of acute pancreatitis have been reported for alogliptin and have been associated with other DPP-4 inhibitors. After initiation of alogliptin, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, alogliptin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. Hepatic effects Postmarketing reports of hepatic dysfunction including hepatic failure have been received. Patients should be observed closely for possible liver abnormalities. Obtain liver function tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury. If an abnormality is found and an alternative etiology is not established, consider discontinuation of alogliptin treatment.

No drug-drug interactions were observed with the CYP-substrates or inhibitors tested, or with renally excreted drugs. In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In vitro studies indicate that alogliptin is neither an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, nor an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations.

However, renal clearance of alogliptin (approximately 170 mL/min) exceeds GFR (120 mL/min), indicating net renal active excretion by an unknown mechanism. NESINA PI V7.0 (CCDS 6.0) 4 In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Alogliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, alogliptin did not meaningfully increase the systemic exposure to drugs that are metabolized by CYP isozymes or drugs that are excreted unchanged in urine when the following drugs were administered concomitantly. No dose adjustment of NESINA is recommended based on results of the described pharmacokinetic studies. Digoxin: Administration of NESINA 25 mg once daily with a P-glycoprotein substrate, digoxin 0.2 mg, once daily for 10 days had no meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics or the renal clearance of digoxin. Warfarin: Administration of NESINA 25 mg once daily with stable doses of warfarin once daily for 7 days had no meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of (S)-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) and (R)-warfarin (a CYP1A2 substrate). In healthy subjects, alogliptin had no effect on prothrombin time (PT) or International Normalized Ratio (INR).

Cimetidine: Administration of alogliptin 100 mg once daily with cimetidine 400 mg once daily for 6 days had no meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics and renal clearance of cimetidine. Sulfonylureas: Administration of NESINA 25 mg once daily for 8 days had no meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of glibenclamide 5 mg. Pioglitazone: Administration of NESINA 25 mg once daily with a CYP2C8 substrate, pioglitazone 45 mg, once daily for 12 days had no meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone and its active metabolites. Atorvastatin: Administration of NESINA 25 mg once daily with a CYP3A4 substrate, atorvastatin 80 mg, once daily for 7 days had no meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and its active metabolites. Oral contraceptives: Administration of NESINA 25 mg once daily with an oral contraceptive (1 mg norethindrone and 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol) for 21 days had no meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CYP3A4 substrates, norethindrone, and ethinyl estradiol.

Effects of Other Drugs on Alogliptin Clinical data described below suggest that alogliptin is not susceptible to interactions when administered concomitantly with the drugs described below. Ciclosporine: Administration of a single dose of a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, ciclosporine 600 mg, with a single dose of NESINA 25 mg did not result in any meaningful changes in the renal clearance of or systemic exposure to alogliptin. Interactions with other P-glycoprotein inhibitors are therefore not expected. Voglibose: Co-administration of voglibose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) and alogliptin did not result in any meaningful changes in the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin. No significant increases in the single-dose systemic exposure to alogliptin were seen when administered concomitantly with multiple doses of drugs that inhibit CYP isozymes: fluconazole (CYP2C9 inhibitor), ketoconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor), and gemfibrozil (CYP2C8 inhibitor). Since NESINA PI V7.0 (CCDS 6.0) 5 alogliptin is primarily renally excreted and CYP-related metabolism is negligible, inhibitors of CYP enzymes are unlikely to affect exposure to alogliptin. Results from clinical studies also demonstrate that there are no meaningful effects of digoxin, metformin, cimetidine, pioglitazone, or atorvastatin on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on fertility The effect of alogliptin on fertility in humans has not been studied.

No adverse effects of alogliptin were observed on fertility, reproductive performance, or early embryonic development in male and female rats given alogliptin orally at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day. The exposure margin at the NOAEL in rats was at least 170-fold the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg alogliptin. Use in pregnancy (Category B3) There are no data from the use of alogliptin in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. As with other oral antihyperglycaemic agents, as a precautionary measure it is preferable to avoid the use of NESINA during pregnancy. Placental transfer of alogliptin occurs in rats. Alogliptin was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits. The exposure margins at the NOAEL established in rats (500 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (200 mg/Kg/day) were approximately 180- and 149-fold, respectively, the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg alogliptin. Higher doses of alogliptin were not teratogenic but resulted in maternal toxicity, and were associated with delayed and/or lack of ossification of bones and decreased fetal body weights. In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, doses of 250 mg/kg/day (approximately 95-fold the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg alogliptin) did not harm the developing embryo or affect offspring growth and development.

Use in lactation It is unknown whether alogliptin is excreted in human milk. Studies in lactating rats indicate that alogliptin is excreted in milk. A risk to the breastfeeding child cannot be excluded. A decision on whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue NESINA therapy should be made taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of NESINA therapy for the woman. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES The effects of this medicine on a person's ability to drive and use machines were not assessed as part of its registration. 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Clinical Trials Experience The information provided is based on a total of 9405 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including 3750 patients treated with NESINA 25 mg and 2476 patients treated with NESINA 12.5 mg, who participated in one phase 2 or 12 phase 3 double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled clinical studies.

These studies evaluated the effects of NESINA on glycaemic control and its safety as monotherapy, as initial combination therapy with metformin or a thiazolidinedione, and as add-on therapy to metformin, or a sulphonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione (with or without metformin or a sulphonylurea), or insulin (with or without metformin). In a pooled analysis of the data from 13 studies, the overall incidences of adverse events, serious adverse events and adverse events resulting in discontinuation of therapy were comparable in patients treated with NESINA 25 mg, NESINA 12.5 mg, active control or placebo. The most common adverse reaction in patients treated with NESINA 25 mg was headache. The safety of alogliptin between the elderly (≥ 65 years old) and non-elderly (< 65 years old) was similar.

In the prospective randomized controlled cardiovascular outcomes study, NESINA PI V7.0 (CCDS 6.0) 7 investigator reported events of hypoglycaemia were similar in patients receiving placebo (6.5%) and patients receiving alogliptin (6.7%) in addition to standard of care. Therefore, based on this analysis, NESINA was considered to be risk neutral with respect to hypoglycaemia (see Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use). Elderly patients (≥ 65 years old) with type 2 diabetes mellitus are considered more susceptible to episodes of hypoglycaemia than patients < 65 years old.

NESINA PI V7.0 (CCDS 6.0) 8 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Mechanism of action Alogliptin is a potent (IC50 around 7nM) and highly selective (>10,000 fold selectivity versus DPP-8 or DPP-9), reversible, competitive inhibitor of DPP-4, an enzyme that rapidly degrades incretin hormones. The incretins are part of an endogenous hormonal system involved in the physiological regulation of glucose and insulin homeostasis. The incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released from the intestine throughout the day and their levels are markedly increased in response to ingestion of a meal. The incretins stimulate insulin synthesis and glucose-dependent insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells. This incretin effect accounts for approximately 70% of insulin secretion in response to a meal. GLP-1 also suppresses glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha-cells which leads"}

The incretins stimulate insulin synthesis and glucose-dependent insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells. This incretin effect accounts for approximately 70% of insulin secretion in response to a meal. GLP-1 also suppresses glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha-cells which leads to reduced hepatic glucose production, delayed gastric emptying and increased satiety. In nonclinical models, GLP-1 and GIP have also been shown to preserve beta-cell mass through regulation of beta-cell neogenesis, proliferation and apoptosis. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, levels of GLP-1 are reduced and the actions of both GLP 1 and GIP are blunted. This markedly diminished incretin effect contributes to hyperglycaemia. DPP 4 inhibition targets the diminished incretin effect by increasing circulating blood levels of endogenous incretins which in turn increase insulin levels and decrease glucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. The increase in insulin levels enhances glucose uptake by tissues and the decrease in glucagon levels reduces hepatic glucose production leading to improved glycaemic control. Alogliptin is selective for DPP-4 and does not inhibit the activity of other closely related enzymes in vitro at concentrations 15-fold greater than the mean human plasma exposure at the recommended clinical dose. Alogliptin (mean IC50 = 6.9) is more than 10,000-fold more selective for DPP 4 than other related enzymes including DPP-8 and DPP-9.

Alogliptin (mean IC50 = 6.9) is more than 10,000-fold more selective for DPP 4 than other related enzymes including DPP-8 and DPP-9. Administration of NESINA 25 mg to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus produced peak inhibition of DPP-4 within 1 to 2 hours and exceeded 93% both after a single 25 mg dose and after 14 days of once daily dosing. Inhibition of DPP 4 remained above 81% at 24 hours after 14 days of dosing. The 4-hour postprandial glucose concentrations were consistently reduced from baseline following breakfast, lunch and dinner. When these glucose concentrations were averaged across all 3 meals, 14 days of treatment with NESINA 25 mg resulted in a mean placebo-corrected reduction from baseline of 1.95 mmol/L. Both NESINA 25 mg alone and in combination with 30 mg pioglitazone demonstrated significant decreases in postprandial glucose and postprandial glucagon whilst significantly increasing postprandial active GLP-1 levels at Week 16 compared to placebo (p<0.05). In addition, NESINA 25 mg alone and in combination with 30 mg pioglitazone produced statistically significant (p<0.001) reductions in total triglycerides at Week 16 as measured by postprandial incremental AUC(0 8) change from baseline compared to placebo. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, parallel-group study, 257 subjects were administered either alogliptin 50 mg, alogliptin 400 mg, moxifloxacin 400 mg, or placebo once-daily for a total of 7 days.

A total of 14779 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including 6448 patients treated with NESINA 25 mg and 2476 patients treated with NESINA 12.5 mg, participated in one phase 2 or 13 phase 3 (including the cardiovascular outcomes study) double blind, placebo- or active-controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effects of NESINA on glycaemic control and its safety. In these studies, 2257 NESINA-treated patients were ≥ 65 years old and 386 NESINA-treated patients were ≥ 75 years old. The studies included 5744 patients with mild renal impairment, 1290 patients with moderate renal impairment and 82 patients with severe renal impairment/end-stage renal disease treated with NESINA.

Overall, treatment with the recommended daily dose of NESINA 25 mg improved glycaemic control when given as monotherapy and as initial or add-on combination therapy. This was determined by clinically relevant and statistically significant reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to control from baseline to study endpoint. Reductions in HbA1c were similar across different subgroups including renal impairment, age, gender, race and body mass index (BMI). Clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c compared to control were also observed with NESINA 25 mg regardless of baseline background medication dose. Higher baseline HbA1c was associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c. Generally, the effects of NESINA on body weight and lipids were neutral. NESINA as add-on therapy to metformin The addition of NESINA 25 mg once daily to metformin therapy (mean dose = 1846.7 mg) resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline in HbA1c and FPG at Week 26 when compared to the addition of placebo (Table 2) (Study SYR-322-MET-008).

Elderly patients (≥ 65 years old) (Study SYR-322-303) Treatment with NESINA 25 mg once daily resulted in improvements from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52 that were non-inferior to those produced by glipizide (mean dose = 5.4 mg). Importantly, despite NESINA and glipizide having similar HbA1c and FPG changes from baseline, episodes of hypoglycaemia were notably less frequent in patients receiving NESINA 25 mg (5.4%) compared to those receiving glipizide (26.0%).

NESINA PI V7.0 (CCDS 6.0) 14 Cardiovascular Outcomes (EXAMINE study) A prospective randomized cardiovascular outcomes safety study was conducted with 5380 type 2 diabetes patients to examine the effect of alogliptin compared with placebo (when added to standard of care) on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including time to the first occurrence of any event in the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke in patients with a recent (15 to 90 days) acute coronary event. In addition to the recent ACS event, the patients in this study were at higher risk for a cardiovascular event with a history of: myocardial infarction (88%), congestive heart failure (27.9%), unstable angina (31.1%), cerebrovascular accident (7.2%), hypertension (83.1%), dyslipidaemias (57.2%) and renal impairment (moderate: 26.2%; severe/end/stage renal disease: 2.9%). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 61 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.2 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.0%. All subjects received concomitant medications during the study, primarily antidiabetic agents.

The study demonstrated that alogliptin did not increase the risk of having a MACE compared to placebo [Hazard Ratio: 0.96; 1-sided 99% Confidence Interval: 0-1.16]. In the alogliptin group, 11.3% of patients experienced a MACE compared to 11.8% of patients in the placebo group (Table 4).

Absorption The absolute bioavailability of NESINA is approximately 100%. NESINA PI V7.0 (CCDS 6.0) 15 Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in no change in total and peak exposure to alogliptin. NESINA may, therefore, be administered with or without food. After administration of single, oral doses of up to 800 mg in healthy subjects, alogliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring 1 to 2 hours (median Tmax) after dosing. No clinically relevant accumulation after multiple dosing was observed in either healthy subjects or in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Total and peak exposure to alogliptin increased proportionally across single doses of up to 100 mg alogliptin. The inter-subject coefficient of variation for alogliptin AUC was small (17%). Distribution Following a single intravenous dose of 12.5 mg alogliptin to healthy subjects, the volume of distribution during the terminal phase was 417 L indicating that the drug is"}

The inter-subject coefficient of variation for alogliptin AUC was small (17%). Distribution Following a single intravenous dose of 12.5 mg alogliptin to healthy subjects, the volume of distribution during the terminal phase was 417 L indicating that the drug is well distributed into tissues. Alogliptin is 20% bound to plasma proteins. Metabolism Alogliptin does not undergo extensive metabolism and 60-71% of the dose is excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. Two minor metabolites were detected following administration of an oral dose of [14C] alogliptin, N demethylated alogliptin, M-I (< 1% of the parent compound), and N-acetylated alogliptin, M-II (< 6% of the parent compound). M-I is an active metabolite with equal potency to alogliptin; M-II does not display any inhibitory activity towards DPP-4 or other DPP related enzymes. In vitro data indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 contribute to the limited metabolism of alogliptin. In vitro studies indicate that alogliptin does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 and does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 at concentrations achieved with the recommended dose of 25 mg alogliptin. Alogliptin exists predominantly as the (R) enantiomer (> 99%) and undergoes little or no chiral conversion in vivo to the (S) enantiomer. The (S)-enantiomer is not detectable at therapeutic doses. Excretion The recommended daily dose of NESINA 25 mg was eliminated with a mean terminal half-life (T1/2) of approximately 21 hours. Following administration of an oral dose of [14C]"}

The (S)-enantiomer is not detectable at therapeutic doses. Excretion The recommended daily dose of NESINA 25 mg was eliminated with a mean terminal half-life (T1/2) of approximately 21 hours. Following administration of an oral dose of [14C] alogliptin, 76% of total radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and involved some active renal tubular secretion, and 13% was recovered in the faeces. Linearity Total exposure (AUC(0-inf)) to alogliptin following administration of a single dose was similar to exposure during one dose interval (AUC(0-24)) after 6 days of once daily dosing. This indicates linear kinetics of alogliptin after multiple dosing. Special populations Renal impairment A single-dose of 50 mg alogliptin was administered to 4 groups of patients with varying degrees of renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCl) using the Cockcroft-Gault formula): mild (CrCl = > 50 NESINA PI V7.0 (CCDS 6.0) 16 to ≤ 80 mL/min), moderate (CrCl = ≥ 30 to ≤ 50 mL/min), severe (CrCl = < 30 mL/min) and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis. Six patients were included in each of the 4 groups. An approximate 1.7-fold increase in AUC for alogliptin was observed in patients with mild renal impairment. However, as the distribution of AUC values for alogliptin in these patients was within the same range as control subjects, no dose adjustment for patients with mild renal impairment is necessary (see Section 4.2 Dose and Method of Administration). In patients with moderate or severe renal"}

However, as the distribution of AUC values for alogliptin in these patients was within the same range as control subjects, no dose adjustment for patients with mild renal impairment is necessary (see Section 4.2 Dose and Method of Administration). In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, or ESRD on haemodialysis, an increase in systemic exposure to alogliptin of approximately 2 and 4-fold was observed, respectively. Patients with ESRD underwent haemodialysis immediately after alogliptin dosing. Based on mean dialysate concentrations, approximately 7% of the drug was removed during a 3-hour haemodialysis session. Therefore, in order to maintain systemic exposures to NESINA that are similar to those observed in patients with normal renal function, lower doses of NESINA should be used in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, or ESRD requiring dialysis (see Section 4.2 Dose and Method of Administration). There was no significant difference in exposure to the active metabolite, M-I (< 1% of the parent compound), in patients with mild renal impairment compared to control subjects. Total exposure to M-I was approximately 2- and 3-fold higher in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, respectively. However, the ratios of AUC for M I/alogliptin in control subjects and patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD were similar. Hepatic impairment Total exposure to alogliptin was approximately 10% lower and peak exposure was approximately 8% lower in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy control subjects.

Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh scores of 5 to 9). NESINA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score > 9, see Section 4.2 Dose and Method of Administration). Age, gender, race, body weight Age (≥ 65 years old), gender, race (white, black and Asian) and body weight did not have any clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin.

Chemically, alogliptin is prepared as a benzoate salt, which is identified as 2-({6-[(3R)-3- aminopiperidin-1-yl]-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl}methyl)benzonitrile monobenzoate. Alogliptin benzoate is a white to off-white, crystalline powder, containing one asymmetric carbon in the aminopiperidine moiety. It is soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide, sparingly soluble in water and methanol, slightly soluble in ethanol, and very slightly soluble in octanol and isopropyl acetate. The partition coefficient (C1-octanol/Caqueous) of alogliptin benzoate at 25°C and pH 7.4 is -0.5. The pKa is 8.5.

ONGLYZA decreases the amount of sugar made by the body. ONGLYZA works when blood sugar is high, especially after a meal. This is when the body needs the greatest amount of help in lowering blood sugar. ONGLYZA also lowers blood sugar between meals. ONGLYZA by itself is unlikely to cause low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) because it does not work when your blood sugar is low. ONGLYZA is used to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ONGLYZA is used in combination with certain other medicines (metformin, medicines such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, insulin, a sulfonylurea medicine such as glimepiride or glibenclamide or metformin plus a sulfonylurea or a SGLT2 inhibitor such as dapagliflozin) to help lower blood sugar levels. ONGLYZA is used when diet plus exercise and the single medicine do not provide adequate blood sugar level control.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin and the insulin that your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood and can lead to serious medical problems. The main goal of treating diabetes is to lower your blood sugar to a normal level. Lowering and controlling blood sugar may help prevent or delay complications of diabetes, such as heart disease, kidney disease, blindness and amputation. ONGLYZA is not addictive. 2.

It belongs to a group of medicines called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. It works by blocking a protein in the kidneys called SGLT2 and removes blood sugar via the urine.

It belongs to a group of medicines called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. It works by blocking a protein in the kidneys called SGLT2 and removes blood sugar via the urine. As a result, the levels of sugar in your blood are reduced. Jardiance also reduces the amount of salt reabsorbed by your kidneys, which helps to reduce excess strain on the heart. Jardiance may also help to protect your kidneys from further damage caused by high blood sugar levels and excess strain on the heart. Jardiance is used to lower blood sugar levels in adults and children aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus when diet and exercise is not enough to control your blood sugar levels. It may be used either: alone as a single medicine, or in combination with other anti-diabetic medicines such as: metformin, sulfonylurea medicines (such as glimepiride and glibenclamide), pioglitazone, insulin, or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor medicines (such as linagliptin or sitagliptin). In adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, Jardiance can also be used to reduce your risk of dying from your cardiovascular disease. Jardiance is also used with other medicines to treat heart failure and to slow the progression of kidney disease in adult patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Your doctor may have prescribed this medicine for another reason. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why Jardiance has been prescribed for you. Type 2 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes"}

Your doctor may have prescribed this medicine for another reason. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why Jardiance has been prescribed for you. Type 2 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus (also known as non-insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus) develops when your body doesn’t make enough insulin or the insulin your body makes does not work as well as it should. Insulin helps to control your blood sugar levels, and when there is not enough insulin or it does not work well, the amount of sugar in your blood can start to build up. Too much sugar in the blood can cause damage to the body’s cells, and can lead to problems with your eyes, heart, kidneys, and circulation. Heart Failure In heart failure, the heart does not work as well as it should. This means the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The most common symptoms of heart failure are breathlessness, fatigue, tiredness and ankle swelling. Kidney disease Some conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure can lead to kidney problems. These problems develop slowly over several years. Good control of your blood sugar and blood pressure are important in keeping your kidneys healthy, but may not always prevent kidney damage from occurring. 2.

In case of rare hereditary conditions that may be incompatible with an excipient of the product, the use of the product is contraindicated. The JARDIANCE 10 mg tablet contains 162.5 mg of lactose monohydrate and the JARDIANCE 25 mg tablet contains 113 mg of lactose monohydrate per maximum recommended daily dose. Patients with the rare hereditary conditions of galactose intolerance e.g. galactosaemia should not take this medicine. 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE General JARDIANCE should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes (see Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications). Ketoacidosis Cases of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalisation, have been reported in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus treated JARDIANCE PI0145-21 3 with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin.

Ketoacidosis Cases of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalisation, have been reported in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus treated JARDIANCE PI0145-21 3 with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking empagliflozin. Cases of ketoacidosis have also been reported in patients without diabetes mellitus who were treated with JARDIANCE. Patients treated with JARDIANCE who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels as ketoacidosis associated with JARDIANCE may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 13.8 mmol/L. Signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis may include excessive thirst, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalised malaise, and shortness of breath. If ketoacidosis is suspected, JARDIANCE should be discontinued, the patient should be evaluated and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis generally requires insulin, fluid, potassium and carbohydrate replacement. Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may be prolonged after discontinuation of JARDIANCE in some patients, i.e. it may last longer than expected from 5 plasma half-lives of empagliflozin (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous ketoacidosis while on SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved. Before initiating JARDIANCE, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis. insulin pump Factors that predispose patients to ketoacidosis include a low"}

JARDIANCE should be used with caution in these patients. When reducing the insulin dose in patients requiring insulin, caution should be taken (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing JARDIANCE in clinical situations known to predispose ketoacidosis. In these situations, consider monitoring of ketones, even if JARDIANCE treatment has been interrupted. Surgery Treatment with JARDIANCE should be ceased prior to major surgery. An increase in other glucose lowering agents may be required during this time. Patients scheduled for non-urgent surgery who have not ceased empagliflozin should be assessed and consideration should be given to postponing the procedure. Treatment with JARDIANCE may be restarted once the patient's condition has stabilised and oral intake is normal. Complicated urinary tract infections Cases of complicated urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalisation have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including JARDIANCE (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)).

Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Patients should be alerted to the symptoms of urinary tract infection, and advised to seek treatment promptly. JARDIANCE PI0145-21 4 Discontinuation of empagliflozin may be considered in cases of recurrent urinary tract infections. Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene) Cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier’s gangrene), a rare, but serious and life-threatening necrotising infection, have been reported in female and male patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Serious outcomes have included hospitalisation, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with JARDIANCE who present with pain or tenderness, erythema, swelling in the genital or perineal area, fever, malaise should be evaluated for necrotising fasciitis. If suspected, JARDIANCE should be discontinued and prompt treatment should be instituted (including broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement if necessary). Use in patients at risk for volume depletion Based on the mode of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, osmotic diuresis accompanying glucosuria may lead to a modest decrease in BP.

Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients for whom an empagliflozin-induced drop in BP could pose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on diuretics, patients with a history of hypotension or patients aged 75 years and older. In case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, BP measurements, laboratory tests including haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving empagliflozin. Temporary interruption of treatment with JARDIANCE should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected. Lower limb amputations An increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in a long-term clinical study with another SGLT2 inhibitor. The medicine in that study is not empagliflozin. However, it is unknown whether this constitutes a class effect. In a pooled safety analysis of 12,620 patients with T2DM the frequency of patients with lower limb amputations was similar between empagliflozin and placebo. In the largest placebo-controlled trial in 7020 patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial), in which 88% of all the cases of amputations were reported, lower limb amputations occurred in 1.8% of patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg, in 2.0% of patients treated with empagliflozin 25 mg, and in 1.8% of patients in the placebo arm.

It is important to regularly examine the feet and counsel all diabetic patients on routine preventative footcare. Use in renal impairment Empagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating empagliflozin. Patients with hypovolaemia may be more susceptible to these changes. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalisation and dialysis, in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age. Due to limited experience, it is not recommended to initiate treatment with empagliflozin in patients with an eGFR <20 mL/min/1.73 m2. Glycaemic efficacy of empagliflozin is dependent on renal function and likely absent in patients with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration - Patients with renal impairment). JARDIANCE PI0145-21 5 Monitoring of renal function Assessment of renal function is recommended: • prior to empagliflozin initiation and periodically during treatment, i.e. at least yearly; • prior to initiation of concomitant medicines that may reduce renal function and periodically thereafter.

Cardiomyopathies and severe valvular heart disease Patients with cardiomyopathies associated with infiltration diseases (e.g. amyloidosis), accumulation diseases (e.g. haemochromatosis), muscular dystrophies, pericardial constriction, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or severe valvular disease with surgery expected were excluded from clinical trials of patients with symptomatic heart failure. Therefore, safety and efficacy in these patients has not been established. Patients with symptomatic heart failure of NYHA IV class Limited data on patients with NYHA IV symptoms (i.e. symptoms with minimal activity or at rest) are available. Use in the elderly Patients aged 75 years and older may be at increased risk of volume depletion, therefore, JARDIANCE should be prescribed with caution in these patients (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). In patients aged 85 years and older, initiation of JARDIANCE for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is not recommended due to limited therapeutic experience.

Chronic kidney disease Safety and effectiveness of JARDIANCE for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in children under 18 years of age have not been established. Effect on laboratory tests Urine will test positive for glucose while patients are taking JARDIANCE due to the nature of the mechanism of action of the SGLT2 inhibitors (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties). Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5- AG are unreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycaemic control. JARDIANCE PI0145-21 6 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS Pharmacodynamic Interactions Diuretics Empagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension. Insulin and insulin secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with empagliflozin (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration and 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)). Pharmacokinetic Interactions Lithium Empagliflozin may"}

Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with empagliflozin (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration and 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)). Pharmacokinetic Interactions Lithium Empagliflozin may increase renal lithium excretion and the blood lithium levels may be decreased. Serum concentration of lithium should be monitored more frequently after empagliflozin initiation and dose changes. Please refer the patient to the lithium prescribing doctor in order to monitor serum concentration of lithium. In vitro assessment of drug interactions Empagliflozin does not inhibit, inactivate, or induce CYP450 isoforms. In vitro data suggest that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9. Empagliflozin does not notably inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9 or UGT2B7. At therapeutic doses, the potential for empagliflozin to reversibly inhibit or inactivate the major CYP450 and UGT isoforms is remote. Drug-drug interactions involving the major CYP450 and UGT isoforms with empagliflozin and concomitantly administered substrates of these enzymes are therefore considered unlikely. Empagliflozin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein, but it does not inhibit these efflux transporters at therapeutic doses. Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with drugs that are P-gp substrates. Empagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not OAT1 and OCT2. Empagliflozin does not inhibit"}

Empagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not OAT1 and OCT2. Empagliflozin does not inhibit any of these human uptake transporters at clinically relevant plasma concentrations and, as such, drug-drug interactions with substrates of these uptake transporters are considered unlikely. In vivo assessment of drug interactions No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic interactions were observed when empagliflozin was co-administered with other commonly used medicinal products. Based on results of pharmacokinetic studies no dose adjustment of JARDIANCE is recommended when co- administered with commonly prescribed medicinal products. Empagliflozin pharmacokinetics were similar with and without co-administration of metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, verapamil, ramipril, simvastatin, in torasemide and healthy volunteers and with or without co-administration of hydrochlorothiazide in patients with T2DM. Increases in overall exposure (AUC) of empagliflozin were seen following co-administration with gemfibrozil (59%), rifampicin (35%), or probenecid (53%). These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful. Empagliflozin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, digoxin, ramipril, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and oral contraceptives when co-administered in healthy volunteers.

In female rats this dose was 90- and 155-fold the systemic AUC exposure anticipated with a human dose of 10 and 25 mg. Use in pregnancy (Category D) There are limited data from the use of JARDIANCE in pregnant women. It is recommended to avoid the use of JARDIANCE during pregnancy unless clearly needed. Empagliflozin administered during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg in the rat or rabbit, which corresponds to approximately 48- and 122-times or 128- and 325-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin based on AUC exposure associated with the 25 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively.

No adverse effects on postnatal development were noted at 10 mg/kg/day (maternal exposures approximately equivalent to those seen with a clinical dose of 25 mg). Specialised studies in rats with other members of the pharmacological class have shown toxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to the second and third trimesters of human pregnancy. Similar effects have been seen for empagliflozin at approximately 11 times the clinical AUC exposure associated with the 25 mg dose. These findings were absent after a 13-week drug-free recovery period. JARDIANCE should be used in pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the patients justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Use in lactation No data in humans are available on excretion of empagliflozin into milk. Available nonclinical data in animals have shown excretion of empagliflozin in milk.

During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg empagliflozin, were well tolerated. Treatment In the event of an overdose, supportive treatment should be initiated as appropriate to the patient’s clinical status. The removal of empagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied. 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Pharmacotherapeutic group: SGLT2 Inhibitor, ATC code: A10BK03. 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Mechanism of action Empagliflozin is a reversible competitive inhibitor of SGLT2 with an IC50 of 1.3 nM. It has a 5000-fold selectivity over human SGLT1 (IC50 of 6278 nM), responsible for glucose absorption in the gut. SGLT2 is highly expressed in the kidney, whereas expression in other tissues is absent or very low. It is responsible as the predominant transporter for re-absorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hyperglycaemia a higher amount of glucose is filtered and reabsorbed. Empagliflozin improves glycaemic control in patients with T2DM by reducing renal glucose re- absorption. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Through inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with T2DM and hyperglycaemia, excess glucose is excreted in the urine. In patients with T2DM, urinary glucose excretion increased"}

The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Through inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with T2DM and hyperglycaemia, excess glucose is excreted in the urine. In patients with T2DM, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following the first dose of empagliflozin and is continuous over the 24 hour dosing interval. Increased urinary glucose JARDIANCE PI0145-21 14 excretion was maintained at the end of 4-week treatment period, averaging approximately 78 g/day with empagliflozin 25 mg once daily. Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in plasma glucose levels in patients with T2DM. Empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels. There is no direct effect on changes in β cell function and insulin secretion / action, and this contributes to a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell function including Homeostasis Model Assessment-β (HOMA-β) and proinsulin to insulin ratio were noted. In addition urinary glucose excretion triggers calorie loss, associated with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The glucosuria observed with empagliflozin is accompanied by mild diuresis which may contribute to sustained and moderate reduction of blood pressure (BP). Empagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to: increasing tubuloglomerular feedback, reducing intraglomerular pressure, downregulating sympathetic activity, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart"}

This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to: increasing tubuloglomerular feedback, reducing intraglomerular pressure, downregulating sympathetic activity, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and reducing left ventricular wall stress as evidenced by beneficial effects on filling pressures and diastolic function as well as preserving kidney structure and function. Other effects such as an increase in haematocrit, a reduction in body weight and blood pressure may underlie some of the cardiac and renal beneficial effects. Clinical Trials Type 2 diabetes mellitus A total of 17,331 patients with T2DM were evaluated in 15 double-blind, placebo- and active- controlled clinical studies, of which 4603 patients received empagliflozin 10 mg and 5567 received empagliflozin 25 mg. Six studies had a treatment duration of 24 weeks; in extensions of applicable studies, and other trials, patients were exposed to JARDIANCE for up to 102 weeks. Treatment with empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylurea, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and insulin lead to clinically relevant improvements in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP, respectively).

There was a clinically meaningful improvement in HbA1c in all subgroups of gender, race, geographic region, time since diagnosis of T2DM, BMI, insulin resistance based on HOMA-IR, and beta cell function based on HOMA-β. Higher baseline HbA1c was associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c. Clinically meaningful HbA1c reduction was seen in patients with eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73m² (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration - Patients with renal impairment). In patients aged 75 years and older, reduced efficacy of JARDIANCE was observed. Empagliflozin as monotherapy The efficacy and safety of empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) as monotherapy was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study of 24 weeks duration in treatment-naïve patients. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment. The key secondary endpoints were the change from baseline in body weight and blood pressure (systolic, SBP and diastolic, DBP) after 24 weeks of treatment.

There were no clinically relevant differences in empagliflozin pharmacokinetics between healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM. Administration of 25 mg empagliflozin after intake of a high-fat and high calorie meal resulted in slightly lower exposure; AUC decreased by approximately 16% and Cmax decreased by approximately 37%, compared to fasted condition. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not considered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food. Distribution The apparent steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73.8 L, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin JARDIANCE PI0145-21 45 solution to healthy subjects, the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 36.8% and plasma protein binding was 86.2%. Metabolism No major metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in human plasma and the most abundant metabolites were three glucuronide conjugates (2-O-, 3-O-, and 6-O-glucuronide). Systemic exposure of each metabolite was less than 10% of total drug-related material. In vitro studies suggested that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9.

With once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were reached by the fifth dose. Consistent with half-life, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to plasma AUC, was observed at steady-state. Following administration of an oral [14C]- empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects, approximately 95.6% of the drug related radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (41.2%) or urine (54.4%). The majority of drug related radioactivity recovered in faeces was unchanged parent drug and approximately half of drug related radioactivity excreted in urine was unchanged parent drug.

No renal tumours were seen at 300 mg/kg/day (11- and 28-times the exposure at the clinical dose of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively). These tumours are likely associated with a metabolic pathway not present in humans, and are considered to be irrelevant to patients given 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin. No drug-related tumours were seen in female mice or female rates at doses up to 1000 and 700 mg/kg/day, respectively, resulting in exposures at least 60 times that expected at the clinical dose of 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin. In male rats, treatment-related benign vascular proliferative lesions (haemangiomas) of the mesenteric lymph node, were observed at 700 mg/kg/day, but not at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 26- and 65-times the exposure at the clinical does of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively).

These events may lead to dehydration, which could cause a deterioration in renal function including acute renal failure. Patients treated with dulaglutide should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration, particularly in relation to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. Dulaglutide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis, and is therefore not recommended in these patients. Events related to impaired gastric emptying, including severe gastroparesis, have been reported. Monitor and consider dose modification or discontinuation in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms while on treatment. Acute Pancreatitis Acute Pancreatitis has been reported with use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including dulaglutide. Patients should be informed of the symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If acute pancreatitis is suspected TRULICITY should be discontinued until evaluation is complete. In the absence of other signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic enzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis (see 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable Effects)). If the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed, TRULICITY should be permanently discontinued. Risk of hypoglycaemia Patients receiving TRULICITY in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin.

Effects on Laboratory Tests No information on the effect of dulaglutide on laboratory tests is available. 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS Dulaglutide causes a delay in gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology studies, dulaglutide did not affect the absorption of the orally administered medications tested to any clinically relevant degree (e.g., warfarin, metformin, lisinopril, metoprolol, digoxin, paracetamol, norelgestromin, ethinyloestradiol, sitagliptin, atorvastatin). No dosage adjustments of concomitant medications are required. As elimination of dulaglutide is presumed to be by proteolytic degradation into its amino acid components and is not anticipated to be eliminated intact in the urine or metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes, pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs primarily renally eliminated or metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes are not expected. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on fertility No adverse effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats given subcutaneous doses of dulaglutide at ≤16.3 mg/kg every 3 days, yielding exposure to dulaglutide (based on plasma AUC) ≥30 times higher than that in patients at the maximum recommended human dose.

These findings were observed in association with maternal effects (decreased maternal food intake and decreased weight gain) and are not considered likely to reflect direct embryofoetal toxicity or teratogenicity. Memory deficits were observed in the female offspring of rats treated throughout pregnancy and lactation at 1.63 mg/kg every 3 days (yielding 16 times the human clinical exposure). No adverse effects on embryofoetal development were seen in rats and rabbits at subcutaneous doses of 0.49 mg/kg and ≤0.12 mg/kg, respectively, given every 3 days (yielding exposures approximately 4 times higher than that in patients at the maximum recommended human dose).

Gastrointestinal disorders Gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) reported were typically mild or moderate in severity. The onset of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea was observed to peak during the first two weeks of treatment and rapidly decline over the next four weeks, after which they remained relatively constant. In clinical pharmacology studies conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus up to 6 weeks, the majority of gastrointestinal events were reported during the first 2-3 days after the initial dose and declined with subsequent doses. The following adverse reactions were reported more frequently in TRULICITY-treated patients than placebo (frequencies listed, respectively, as: placebo; 1.5 mg): constipation (0.7%, 3.7%), flatulence (1.4%, 3.4%), abdominal distension (0.7%, 2.3%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (0.5%, 2.0%), and eructation (0.2%, 1.6%).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Dulaglutide improves glycaemic control through the sustained effects of lowering fasting, pre- meal and postprandial glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes starting after the first dulaglutide administration and is sustained throughout the once weekly dosing interval. A pharmacodynamic study with TRULICITY demonstrated, in patients with type 2 diabetes, a restoration of first phase insulin secretion to a level that exceeded levels observed in healthy subjects on placebo, and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to an intravenous bolus of glucose, as shown in Figure 1. In the same study, a single 1.5 mg dose of TRULICITY appeared to increase maximal insulin secretion from the β cells, and to enhance β cell function in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus as compared with placebo. Consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile, dulaglutide has a pharmacodynamic profile suitable for once weekly administration (see 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties). vA10.0_SRR_Oct2025 Supersedes: vA9.0_SRR_Feb2025 Page 9 of 25 Figure 1.

Effect of dulaglutide on first and second phase insulin secretion Mechanism of action Dulaglutide is a long acting GLP-1 receptor agonist. Native GLP-1 has a half-life of 1.5 – 2 minutes due to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and renal clearance. In contrast to native GLP-1, dulaglutide is relatively resistant to degradation by DPP-4, and has a large size that slows absorption and reduces renal clearance. These engineering features result in a soluble formulation and a prolonged half-life of 4.7 days, which makes it suitable for once-weekly subcutaneous administration. In addition, the dulaglutide molecule was engineered to prevent the Fcγ-receptor dependent immune response and to reduce its immunogenic potential. Dulaglutide exhibits several anti-hyperglycaemic actions of GLP-1. In the presence of elevated glucose concentrations, dulaglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP in pancreatic beta cells leading to insulin release. Dulaglutide suppresses glucagon secretion which is known to be inappropriately elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes. Lower glucagon concentrations lead to decreased hepatic glucose output. Dulaglutide also slows gastric emptying. vA10.0_SRR_Oct2025 Supersedes: vA9.0_SRR_Feb2025 Page 10 of 25 Clinical trials The efficacy of TRULICITY has been established in eight pivotal Phase 3 studies involving 5,770 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

In the initial dose- finding portion of the study, 7 doses of dulaglutide (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg, and 3.0 mg), sitagliptin, and placebo were assessed. An optimal or maximum utility dose was to be selected based on the use of a pre-defined clinical utility index combining efficacy (HbA1c and weight) and safety (diastolic blood pressure and heart rate) measures. At the completion of the dose-finding portion, the dulaglutide 1.5 mg dose was selected as the optimal dose.

Steady state plasma concentrations were achieved after 2 to 4 weeks of once-weekly administration of dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Exposures after subcutaneous administration of single 1.5 mg dulaglutide doses in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm were comparable. The mean absolute bioavailability of dulaglutide following a single dose subcutaneous administration of one 1.5 mg dose was approximately 47%. Distribution The mean volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of dulaglutide 1.5 mg to steady state in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was approximately 17.4 L. Metabolism Dulaglutide is presumed to be degraded into its component amino acids by general protein catabolism pathways. Elimination The mean apparent clearance of dulaglutide in humans at steady state was 0.107 L/h with an elimination half- life of 4.7 days. Special Populations No dose adjustment is needed based on age, gender, race, ethnicity, body weight, or renal or hepatic impairment.

As a large molecular weight protein, dulaglutide is not expected to interact with DNA or other chromosomal material. Carcinogenicity In a 93-week carcinogenicity study in rats, dulaglutide caused statistically significant, dose- related increases in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumours (adenomas and carcinomas combined) with subcutaneous administration at ≥0.5 mg/kg twice weekly, yielding ≥ 7 times the human clinical exposure following once weekly administration of 1.5 mg dulaglutide. Exposure (plasma AUC) at the no observable effect level for carcinogenicity in the rat (0.05 mg/kg) was subclinical. The human relevance of these findings is unknown. There was no tumourgenic response in a 6-month carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice with subcutaneous doses ≤3 mg/kg twice weekly, yielding exposures up to 5 times higher than that in patients at the maximum recommended human dose. 6.

Empagliflozin is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Clinical trials). To prevent cardiovascular deaths, empagliflozin should be used in conjunction with other measures to reduce cardiovascular risk in line with the current standard of care. 4.2 DOSE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION Life-threatening lactic acidosis can occur due to accumulation of metformin. Risk factors include renal impairment, old age and the use of high doses of metformin above 2000 mg per day. The recommended dose is one JARDIAMET tablet twice daily. Adults with normal renal function (GFR ≥ 90mL/min) The dosage should be individualised on the basis of the patient’s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. The maximum recommended daily dose of JARDIAMET is 25 mg of empagliflozin and 2000 mg of metformin (see Table 1 for additional dosing information). JARDIAMET should be given with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal undesirable effects associated with metformin. Treatment naïve patients The recommended starting dose is 5 mg/500 mg twice daily. If additional glycaemic control is required, adjust dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 25 mg empagliflozin and 2000 mg metformin.

Patients not adequately controlled on the maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone or in combination with other products, including insulin. The recommended starting dose of JARDIAMET should provide empagliflozin 5 mg twice daily (10 mg total daily dose) and the dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. In patients tolerating a total daily dose of empagliflozin 10 mg, the dose can be increased to a total daily dose of empagliflozin 25 mg. Combination use When JARDIAMET is used in combination with a sulfonylurea and/or insulin, a lower dose of sulfonylurea and/or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see Sections 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions and 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)).

Diabetic ketoacidosis JARDIAMET should not be used for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalisation, have been reported in postmarketing surveillance in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking empagliflozin. Patients treated with JARDIAMET who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels as ketoacidosis associated with JARDIAMET may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 13.8 mmol/L. Signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis may include excessive thirst, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalised malaise, and shortness of breath. If ketoacidosis is suspected, JARDIAMET should be discontinued, the patient should be evaluated and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis generally requires insulin, fluid, potassium and carbohydrate replacement. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 4 Diabetic ketoacidosis and glucosuria may be prolonged after discontinuation of JARDIAMET in some patients, i.e. it may last longer than expected from 5 plasma half-lives of empagliflozin (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties).

Factors that predispose patients to ketoacidosis include a low carbohydrate diet, dehydration, acute illness, surgery (see Section Surgery), a previous ketoacidosis, insulin deficiency from any cause (including insulin pump failure, history of pancreatitis, or pancreatic surgery), malnourishment/reduced caloric intake or increased insulin requirements due to infections, and alcohol abuse. JARDIAMET should be used with caution in these patients. When reducing the insulin dose in patients requiring insulin, caution should be taken (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of administration). Consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing JARDIAMET in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. In these situations, consider monitoring of ketones, even if JARDIAMET treatment has been interrupted. Lactic acidosis Lactic acidosis, a very rare but serious metabolic complication, most often occurs at acute worsening of renal function or cardiorespiratory illness or sepsis. Metformin accumulation occurs at acute worsening of renal function and increases the risk of lactic acidosis. In case of dehydration (severe diarrhoea or vomiting, fever or reduced fluid intake), metformin should be temporarily discontinued and contact with a health care professional is recommended. Medicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and NSAIDs) should be initiated with caution in metformin-treated patients. Other risk factors for lactic acidosis"}

Medicinal products that can acutely impair renal function (such as antihypertensives, diuretics and NSAIDs) should be initiated with caution in metformin-treated patients. Other risk factors for lactic acidosis are excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, inadequately controlled diabetes, ketosis, prolonged fasting and any conditions associated with hypoxia, as well as concomitant use of medicinal products that may cause lactic acidosis (see Sections 4.3 Contraindications and 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). Patients and/or care-givers should be informed of the risk of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is characterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, asthenia and hypothermia followed by coma. In case of suspected symptoms, the patient should stop taking metformin and be hospitalised immediately. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH (< 7.35), increased plasma lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio. Cardiac function Patients with heart failure are more at risk of hypoxia and renal insufficiency. In patients with stable chronic heart failure, JARDIAMET may be used with a regular monitoring of cardiac and renal function. For patients with acute and unstable heart failure, JARDIAMET is contraindicated due to the metformin component (see Section 4.3 Contraindications).

Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients for whom an empagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could pose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension or patients aged 75 years and older. In case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving empagliflozin. Temporary interruption of treatment with JARDIAMET should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected. Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalisation in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Discontinuation of JARDIAMET may be considered in cases of recurrent urinary tract infections.

Serious outcomes have included hospitalisation, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with JARDIAMET who present with pain or tenderness, erythema, swelling in the genital or perineal area, fever, malaise should be evaluated for necrotising fasciitis. If suspected, JARDIAMET should be discontinued and prompt treatment should be instituted (including broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement if necessary). Lower limb amputations An increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in a long-term clinical study with another SGLT2 inhibitor. The medicine in that study is not empagliflozin. However, it is unknown whether this constitutes a class effect. In a pooled safety analysis of 12,620 patients with T2DM the frequency of patients with lower limb amputations was similar between empagliflozin and placebo. In the largest placebo-controlled trial in 7020 patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial), in which 88% of all the cases of amputations were reported, lower limb amputations occurred in 1.8% of patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg, in 2.0% of patients treated with empagliflozin 25 mg, and in 1.8% of patients in the placebo arm.

It is important to regularly examine the feet and counsel all diabetic patients on routine preventative footcare. Administration of iodinated contrast agent Intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, resulting in metformin accumulation and an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin should be discontinued prior to or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be stable (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration, and 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). JARDIAMET PI0157-19 6 Surgery Treatment with JARDIAMET should be ceased at least 48 hours prior to major surgery (see Sections Diabetic ketoacidosis and Lactic acidosis). An increase in other glucose lowering agents may be required during this time. Patients scheduled for non-urgent surgery who have not ceased JARDIAMET should be assessed and consideration should be given to postponing the procedure.

Vitamin B12 levels In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum Vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or Vitamin B12 supplementation. It is recommended that vitamin B12 serum levels are monitored annually. The risk of low vitamin B12 levels increases with increasing metformin dose, treatment duration, and/or in patients with risk factors known to cause vitamin B12 deficiency (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Use in patients with renal impairment Empagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating empagliflozin. Patients with hypovolaemia may be more susceptible to these changes. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalisation and dialysis, in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age. Due to the mechanism of action, decreased renal function will result in reduced efficacy of empagliflozin. eGFR should be assessed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter, see section 4.2 Dose and method of administration.

More intensive monitoring of renal function is recommended, particularly following treatment initiation, if empagliflozin is used in patients with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, especially if the eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2. JARDIAMET is contraindicated in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2 and should be temporarily discontinued in the presence of conditions that alter renal function, see section 4.3 Contraindications. Hypoglycaemia JARDIAMET alone does not cause hypoglycaemia under usual circumstances of use, but hypoglycaemia could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose- lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Use in the elderly Patients aged 75 years and older may be at an increased risk of volume depletion, therefore, JARDIAMET should be prescribed with caution in these patients (see Section 4.8 Adverse JARDIAMET PI0157-19 7 effects (Undesirable effects)).

Paediatric Use In the DINAMO paediatric trial conducted in 157 patients in which 52 patients received empagliflozin, 52 linagliptin and 53 placebo (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Clinical trials), the overall safety profile in children and adolescents was similar with the known safety profile seen in adult patients. Therefore, the precautions listed for adult patients must be followed also for the paediatric population. In the DINAMO trial, weight was assessed, after 26 weeks of treatment, there were no relevant differences between placebo and empagliflozin. No effect of metformin on growth and puberty has been detected during controlled clinical studies of one-year duration but no long-term data on these specific points are available. Therefore, a careful follow-up of the effect of metformin on these parameters in metformin- treated children, especially prepubescent children, is recommended. Children aged between 10 and 12 DINAMO trial included 157 patients and 91% were on metformin as background therapy, 25 of these patients were between 10 and 12 years old.

Although efficacy and safety of metformin in these older children and adolescents did not differ from efficacy and safety in adults, particular caution is recommended when prescribing to children aged between 10 and 12 years. Effects on laboratory tests Urine will test positive for glucose while patients are taking JARDIAMET due to the nature of the mechanism of action of the SGLT2 inhibitors (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties). Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycaemic control. 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS General Co-administration of multiple doses of empagliflozin (50 mg once daily) and metformin hydrochloride (1000 mg twice daily) did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either empagliflozin or metformin in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies with JARDIAMET have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with empagliflozin and metformin alone. Paediatric population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 8 Empagliflozin Pharmacodynamic Interactions Diuretics Empagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension.

Pharmacokinetic Interactions Lithium Empagliflozin may increase renal lithium excretion and the blood lithium levels may be decreased. Serum concentration of lithium should be monitored more frequently after empagliflozin initiation and dose changes. Please refer the patient to the lithium prescribing doctor in order to monitor serum concentration of lithium. In vitro assessment of drug interactions Empagliflozin does not inhibit, inactivate, or induce CYP450 isoforms. In vitro data suggest that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7. Empagliflozin does not notably inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. At therapeutic doses, the potential for empagliflozin to reversibly inhibit or inactivate the major CYP450 and UGT isoforms is remote. Drug-drug interactions involving the major CYP450 and UGT isoforms with empagliflozin and concomitantly administered substrates of these enzymes are therefore considered unlikely. Empagliflozin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), but it does not inhibit these efflux transporters at therapeutic doses. Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin is considered unlikely to cause interactions"}

Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with drugs that are P-gp substrates. Empagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not OAT1 and OCT2. Empagliflozin does not inhibit any of these human uptake transporters at clinically relevant plasma concentrations and, as such, drug-drug interactions with substrates of these uptake transporters are considered unlikely. In vivo assessment of drug interactions No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic interactions were observed when empagliflozin was co-administered with other commonly used medicinal products. Based on results of pharmacokinetic studies no dose adjustment of empagliflozin is recommended when co- administered with commonly prescribed medicinal products. Empagliflozin pharmacokinetics were similar with and without co-administration of glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, verapamil, ramipril, simvastatin, in healthy volunteers and with or without co-administration of torasemide and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with T2DM.

Inadvisable combinations Alcohol There is increased risk of lactic acidosis in acute alcohol intoxication (particularly in the case of fasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment) due to the metformin component of JARDIAMET (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use – Lactic acidosis). Consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing alcohol should be avoided. Alcohol may make the signs of hypoglycaemia less clear, and delayed hypoglycaemia can occur. The CNS depressant effects of alcohol plus hypoglycaemia can make driving or the operation of dangerous machinery much more hazardous. Combinations requiring precautions for use Some medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics.

Medicinal products with intrinsic hyperglycaemic activity e.g. glucocorticoids and tetracosactides (systemic and local routes), beta-2-agonists, danazol, chlorpromazine at high dosages of 100 mg per day and diuretics More frequent blood glucose monitoring may be required, especially at the beginning of treatment. If necessary, adjust the metformin dosage during therapy with the respective medicinal product and upon discontinuation. Diuretics, especially loop diuretics May increase the risk of lactic acidosis due to their potential to decrease renal function. ACE-inhibitors ACE-inhibitors may decrease the blood glucose levels. Therefore, dose adjustment of JARDIAMET may be necessary when such medicinal products are added or discontinued. Calcium channel blockers Calcium channel blockers may affect glucose control in diabetic patients; regular monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended. Beta-blockers Co-administration of metformin and beta-blockers may result in a potentiation of the anti- hyperglycaemic action. In addition, some of the premonitory signs of hypoglycaemia, in particular tachycardia, may be masked. Monitoring of blood glucose should be undertaken during dosage adjustment of either agent.

Consequently, the prothrombin time should be closely monitored in patients in whom metformin and vitamin K antagonists are being co-administered. Cessation of metformin in patients receiving vitamin K antagonists can cause marked increases in the prothrombin time. Nifedipine A single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of metformin and nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in the urine. Tmax and half-life of metformin were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Metformin had minimal effects on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Organic cation transporters (OCT) Metformin is a substrate of both transporters OCT1 and OCT2. Co-administration of metformin with: • Substrates/inhibitors of OCT1 (such as verapamil) may reduce efficacy of metformin. • Inducers of OCT1 (such as rifampicin) may increase gastrointestinal absorption and efficacy. • Substrates/inhibitors of OCT2 (such as cimetidine, dolutegravir, crizotinib, olaparib, daclatasvir, vandetanib) may decrease the renal elimination of metformin and thus lead to an increase in metformin plasma concentration.

NSAID May increase the risk of lactic acidosis and adversely affect renal function. Therefore, caution is advised when these drugs are co-administered with metformin and a dose adjustment may be considered, particularly in patients with renal impairment. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on Fertility No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted with JARDIAMET or its individual components. Nonclinical studies in animals with the individual components do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. Empagliflozin Studies in rats at doses up to 700 mg/kg/day, do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. In female rats this dose was 90- and 155-fold the systemic AUC exposure anticipated with a human dose of 10 and 25 mg.

When the patient plans to become pregnant, and during pregnancy, it is recommended that diabetes is not treated with JARDIAMET, but insulin be used to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible, to reduce the risk of malformations of the foetus associated with abnormal blood glucose levels. A study in pregnant rats did not reveal teratogenicity or other adverse effects on embryofetal development with co-administration of empagliflozin and metformin at oral doses up to 100/200 mg/kg/day, yielding exposures of approximately 35- and 14-times the clinical AUC exposure of empagliflozin associated with the 5 and 12.5 mg twice daily doses, respectively, and 4-times the clinical AUC exposure of metformin associated with the 1000 mg twice daily dose. At a dose of 300/600 mg/kg/day, associated with 49-times the exposure to empagliflozin and 8-times the exposure to metformin in humans at the maximum recommended dose, teratogenicity attributable to the metformin component was observed. Empagliflozin Empagliflozin administered during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg in the rat or rabbit, which corresponds to approximately 48- and 122-times or 128- and 325-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin based on AUC exposure associated with the 12.5"}

Empagliflozin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20 resulted in reduced weight gain in offspring at ≥30 mg/kg/day yielding maternal exposures approximately 4- and 11-times those in humans associated with 12.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily doses, respectively. Specialised studies in rats with other members of the pharmacological class have shown toxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to the second and third trimesters of human pregnancy. Similar effects have been seen for empagliflozin at approximately 11-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin based on AUC exposure associated with the 12.5 mg twice daily dose. These findings were absent after a 13 week drug-free recovery period. Metformin hydrochloride Metformin was not teratogenic in rats"}

Low blood sugar may occur in patients who already take another medication to treat diabetes such as a sulfonylurea or insulin while taking JARDIAMET. The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance e.g. driving a car or operating machinery. People should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving or operating machinery. 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Reporting suspected adverse effects Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product.

The effect of empagliflozin on urinary glucose excretion is associated with osmotic diuresis, which could affect the hydration status of patients age 75 years and older. In patients ≥75 years of age volume depletion events have been reported in a single patient treated with empagliflozin 25 mg plus metformin. Blood creatinine increased and glomerular filtration rate decreased Use of empagliflozin was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR. These changes were observed to reverse after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute haemodynamic changes play a role in the renal function abnormalities observed with empagliflozin. Renal-related adverse reactions (e.g. acute kidney injury, renal impairment, acute prerenal failure) may occur in patients treated with empagliflozin.

Mechanism of action Empagliflozin Empagliflozin is a reversible competitive inhibitor of SGLT2 with an IC50 of 1.3 nM. It has a 5000-fold selectivity over human SGLT1 (IC50 of 6278 nM), responsible for glucose absorption in the gut. SGLT2 is highly expressed in the kidney, whereas expression in other tissues is absent or very low. It is responsible as the predominant transporter for re-absorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hyperglycaemia a higher amount of glucose is filtered and reabsorbed.

Empagliflozin improves glycaemic control in patients with T2DM by reducing renal glucose re- absorption. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Through inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with T2DM and hyperglycaemia, excess glucose is excreted in the urine. In patients with T2DM, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following the first dose of empagliflozin and is continuous over the 24 hour dosing interval. Increased urinary glucose excretion was maintained at the end of 4-week treatment period, averaging approximately 78 g/day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily. Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in plasma glucose levels in patients with T2DM. Empagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 19 The insulin independent mechanism of action of empagliflozin contributes to a low risk of hypoglycaemia. The effect of empagliflozin in lowering blood glucose is independent of beta cell function and insulin pathway. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell function including Homeostasis Model Assessment-β (HOMA-β) and proinsulin to insulin ratio were noted. In addition urinary glucose excretion triggers calorie loss, associated with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The glucosuria observed with empagliflozin is accompanied by mild diuresis which may contribute to sustained and moderate reduction of blood pressure (BP).

The glucosuria observed with empagliflozin is accompanied by mild diuresis which may contribute to sustained and moderate reduction of blood pressure (BP). Metformin hydrochloride Metformin hydrochloride is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia. Metformin hydrochloride may act via 3 mechanisms: 1) reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis 2) in muscle, by increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation 3) and delay of intestinal glucose absorption. Metformin hydrochloride stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase. Metformin hydrochloride increases the transport capacity of all types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUTs) known to date. In humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin hydrochloride has favourable effects on lipid metabolism. This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium or long-term clinical studies: metformin hydrochloride reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Clinical trials A total of 10,224 patients with type 2 diabetes were treated in 9 double-blind, placebo or active-controlled clinical studies, of at least 24 weeks duration, of which 2947 patients received empagliflozin 10 mg and 3703 received empagliflozin 25 mg as add-on to metformin therapy. led insulin) Treatment with empagliflozin in combination with metformin with or without other background (pioglitazone, sulfonylurea, DPP-4 to clinically relevant inhibitors, and improvements in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body"}

The study population consisted of 38.2% male and 61.8% female patients with a mean age of 14.5 years (range: 10 to 17 years); 51.6% were 15 years of age or older. 49.7% of the study population were White, 5.7% Asian and 31.2% Black/African American. The mean BMI was 36.04 kg/m2, the mean body weight was 99.92 kg. Only patients with an eGFR of ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were included in the DINAMO study. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 36 Empagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the primary endpoint change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of 26 weeks regardless of rescue therapy or treatment discontinuation.

Administration of 12.5 mg empagliflozin/1000 mg metformin under fed conditions resulted in a 9% decrease in AUC and a 28% decrease in Cmax for empagliflozin, when compared to fasted conditions. For metformin, AUC decreased by 12% and Cmax decreased by 26% compared to fasting conditions. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin and metformin is not considered to be clinically relevant. However, as metformin is recommended to be given with meals, JARDIAMET is also proposed to be given with food. The following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of JARDIAMET. Empagliflozin Absorption The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin have been extensively characterised in healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM. After oral administration, empagliflozin was rapidly JARDIAMET PI0157-19 37 absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring at a median tmax 1.5 h post-dose. Thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow terminal phase. The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 1870 nmol·h/L and 259 nmol/L with empagliflozin 10 mg and 4740 nmol·h/L and 687 nmol/L with empagliflozin 25 mg once daily, respectively.

Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner. The single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics parameters of empagliflozin were linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time. There were no clinically relevant differences in empagliflozin pharmacokinetics between healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM. suggesting similar The pharmacokinetics of 5 mg empagliflozin twice daily and 10 mg empagliflozin once daily were compared in healthy subjects. Overall exposure (AUCss) of empagliflozin over a 24-hour period with 5 mg administered twice daily was similar to 10 mg administered once daily. As expected, empagliflozin 5 mg administered twice daily compared with 10 mg empagliflozin once daily resulted in lower Cmax and higher trough plasma empagliflozin concentrations (Cmin). Administration of 25 mg empagliflozin after intake of a high-fat and high calorie meal resulted in slightly lower exposure; AUC decreased by approximately 16% and Cmax decreased by approximately 37%, compared to fasted condition. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not considered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food. Distribution The apparent steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73.8 L, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects, the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 36.8% and plasma protein binding was 86.2%.

Metabolism No major metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in human plasma and the most abundant metabolites were three glucuronide conjugates (2-O-, 3-O-, and 6-O-glucuronide). Systemic exposure of each metabolite was less than 10% of total drug-related material. In vitro studies suggested that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7. Excretion The apparent terminal elimination half-life of empagliflozin was estimated to be 12.4 h and apparent oral clearance was 10.6 L/h based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. The inter-subject and residual variabilities for empagliflozin oral clearance were 39.1% and 35.8%, respectively. With once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were reached by the fifth dose. Consistent with the half-life, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to plasma AUC, was observed at steady-state. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects, approximately 95.6% of the drug related radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (41.2%) or urine (54.4%). The majority of drug related radioactivity recovered in faeces was unchanged parent drug and approximately half of drug related radioactivity excreted in urine was unchanged parent drug.

After an oral dose, the non-absorbed fraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 38 After oral administration, metformin hydrochloride absorption is saturable and incomplete. It is assumed that the pharmacokinetics of metformin hydrochloride absorption are non-linear. At the recommended metformin hydrochloride doses and dosing schedules, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally less than 1 microgram/mL. In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin hydrochloride plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed 5 microgram/mL, even at maximum doses. Food decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin hydrochloride. Following administration of a dose of 850 mg, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% decrease in AUC (area under the curve) and a 35 minute prolongation of the time to peak plasma concentration were observed. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. Distribution Plasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin hydrochloride partitions into erythrocytes.

The red blood cells most likely represent a secondary compartment of distribution. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) ranged between 63-276 L. Metabolism Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism. Excretion Renal clearance of metformin hydrochloride is >400 mL/min, indicating that metformin hydrochloride is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is approximately 6.5 hours. When renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to that of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of metformin hydrochloride in plasma. Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups Paediatric Empagliflozin Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of empagliflozin 5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg were investigated in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with T2DM. The observed pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (urinary glucose excretion) relationship of adult and paediatric patients was comparable after accounting for significant covariates. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (HbA1c change from baseline) of empagliflozin 10 mg with a possible dose-increase to 25 mg were investigated in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with T2DM.

Metformin hydrochloride Single dose study: After single doses of metformin 500 mg, paediatric patients have shown a similar pharmacokinetic profile to that observed in healthy adults. Multiple dose study: Data are restricted to one study. After repeated doses of 500 mg twice daily for 7 days in paediatric patients the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and systemic exposure (AUC0-t) were reduced by approximately 33% and 40%, respectively compared to diabetic adults who received repeated doses of 500 mg twice daily for 14 days. As the dose is individually titrated based on glycaemic control, this is of limited clinical relevance. JARDIAMET PI0157-19 39 Elderly Empagliflozin Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin hydrochloride Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin hydrochloride is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmax is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin hydrochloride pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function.

Body mass index had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Gender Empagliflozin No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin hydrochloride Metformin hydrochloride pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes when analysed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, the antihyperglycaemic effect of metformin hydrochloride was comparable in males and females.

Metformin hydrochloride There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative. Carcinogenicity Empagliflozin Two-year oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. There was an increase in renal adenomas and carcinomas in male mice given empagliflozin at 1000 mg/kg/day.

Saxenda® contain the active ingredient liraglutide, similar to a naturally occurring hormone called GLP-1 that is released from the intestine after a meal. Saxenda® is used for weight loss, in addition to diet and exercise, in adults aged 18 years and above who have: ⦁ ⦁ a BMI of 30 or more (obese), or a BMI of 27 or more and less than 30 (overweight) and weight related health problems (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in the blood or breathing problems during sleep, called ‘obstructive sleep apnoea’). Saxenda® should be used with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. BMI (Body Mass Index) is a simple measure of your weight in relation to your height. It is calculated by dividing your weight in kg by your height in metres squared. Saxenda® works by acting on receptors in the brain that control your appetite, causing you to feel fuller and less hungry. This may help you eat less food and reduce your body weight. Weight loss normally starts within 2 weeks and continues for 9 to 12 months on Saxenda® treatment. Saxenda® may then help"}

SAXENDA contains liraglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Liraglutide is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SAXENDA is a solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. One mL contains 6 mg salt-free anhydrous liraglutide. One pre-filled pen contains 18 mg liraglutide in 3 mL. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1 List of excipients. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 3. SAXENDA is a solution for injection. It is a sterile, clear, colourless, isotonic solution, pH=8.15. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS Therapeutic Indications 4.1 SAXENDA is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adult patients with an initial Body Mass Index (BMI) of • ≥30 kg/m2 (obese) or • ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight related comorbidity, such as dysglycaemia (pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus), hypertension, dyslipidaemia, or obstructive sleep apnoea. Treatment with SAXENDA should be discontinued after 12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day dose if a patient has not lost at least 5% of their initial body weight. 4.2 Dose and Method of Administration SAXENDA has not been studied in patients taking insulin. SAXENDA and insulin should not be used together [see section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use]. SAXENDA and VICTOZA both contain the same active ingredient, liraglutide, and therefore should"}

Injection sites should always be rotated within the same region in order to reduce the risk of cutaneous amyloidosis [see section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)]. The injection site and timing can be changed without dose adjustment. However it is preferable that SAXENDA is injected around the same time of the day, when the most convenient time of the day has been chosen. If a dose is missed within 12 hours from when it is usually taken, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible. If there is less than 12 hours to the next dose, the patient should not take the missed dose and resume the once-daily regimen with the next scheduled dose. An extra dose or increase in dose should not be taken to make up for the missed dose. SAXENDA should not be mixed with other injectable medicinal products (e.g. infusion fluids [see section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use]). Dosage Adjustment Patients with type 2 diabetes When initiating SAXENDA, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin or insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia [see section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use and 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)].

Therefore, the increased risk of residual gastric content because of delayed gastric emptying should be considered prior to performing procedures with GA or deep sedation. Saxenda® Product Information – VV-LAB-097235 Page 3 of 27 Cardiovascular events Increase in heart rate An increase in heart rate with SAXENDA was observed in clinical trials [see section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)]. Heart rate should be monitored at regular intervals consistent with good clinical practice. Patients should be informed of the symptoms of increased heart rate (palpitations or feelings of a racing heartbeat while at rest). For patients who experience a sustained increase in resting heart rate, SAXENDA should be discontinued. The effect on the heart rate of co-administration of SAXENDA with other medicines that increase heart rate (e.g., sympathomimetic drugs) has not been evaluated.

Dehydration, renal impairment and acute renal failure Patients treated with SAXENDA should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to gastrointestinal side effects and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. In patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide, there have been reports of acute renal injury/failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring haemodialysis [see section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)]. Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea leading to volume depletion. Some of the reported events occurred in patients receiving one or more medications known to affect renal function and volume status. Altered renal function has been reversed in many of the reported cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including liraglutide.

Use in the elderly In SAXENDA clinical trials, 232 (6.9%) of the SAXENDA-treated patients were 65 years of age and over, and 17 (0.5%) of the SAXENDA treated patients were 75 years of age and over. Patients ≥65 years may experience more gastrointestinal adverse reactions with SAXENDA than younger patients [see sub-sections above in section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use on Dehydration, renal impairment and acute renal failure]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. Use caution in patients aged 65-74 years.

After initiation of SAXENDA, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, SAXENDA should be discontinued and appropriate management initiated. If acute pancreatitis is confirmed, SAXENDA should not be restarted. In SAXENDA clinical trials, acute pancreatitis was confirmed by adjudication more commonly in SAXENDA-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients [see section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)]. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using SAXENDA, since these patients were excluded from clinical trials. SAXENDA is not recommended for use in patients with a history of pancreatitis. In the absence of other signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic enzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis In the SAXENDA clinical trials, cholelithiasis or cholecystitis was reported more commonly in SAXENDA-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients [see section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)]. The majority of SAXENDA-treated patients with cholelithiasis or cholecystitis required cholecystectomy. Substantial or rapid weight loss can increase the risk of acute gallbladder disease; however, the incidence was greater in SAXENDA-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients even after accounting for weight loss. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.

SAXENDA is not recommended in these patients because it is associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Hypoglycaemia with concomitant use of anti-diabetic therapy The risk of serious hypoglycaemia is increased when SAXENDA is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g. sulfonylureas) in patients with type 2 diabetes [see Table 2 in section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)]. The risk of hypoglycaemia can be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea. The addition of SAXENDA in patients treated with insulin has not been evaluated. The SCALE-Diabetes trial excluded patients on insulin [see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties-Clinical trials]. SAXENDA and insulin should not be used together. SAXENDA can lower blood glucose. Monitor blood glucose parameters before starting SAXENDA and during SAXENDA treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes. If needed, adjust co-administered anti-diabetic medicines based on glucose monitoring and risk of hypoglycaemia. Malignancies In the clinical development program for weight loss, there was no imbalance for all neoplasms, combined. However, when subgroup analyses were done by individual types of cancer, Saxenda® Product Information – VV-LAB-097235 Page 5 of 27 imbalances were identified, including invasive breast cancer in women and colorectal neoplasms (mainly adenomas) [see section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)].

Thyroid C-cell tumours Liraglutide caused thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas in two-year studies in mice and rats. Such medullary thyroid cancers are extremely rare cancers in humans. C-cell neoplasia was observed in mice at subcutaneous doses ≥1mg/kg/day (relative exposure based on plasma AUC, ≥8) and in rats at all doses tested (≥0.075mg/kg/day subcutaneously; relative exposure, ≥0.5). No tumours or other C-cell proliferative changes were seen in monkeys treated with liraglutide for 20 months (≤5 mg/kg/day subcutaneously; relative exposure, ≤70). The findings in mice and rats are mediated by a specific GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. The relevance for humans is likely to be low but cannot presently be completely excluded. Thyroid disease In clinical trials in type 2 diabetes, thyroid adverse events such as goitre have been reported, in particular in patients with pre-existing thyroid disease. Cases of increased blood calcitonin were also observed in the weight management clinical trials. SAXENDA should be used with caution in patients with thyroid disease. Hypersensitivity reactions There have been reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, then the patient should discontinue SAXENDA and other suspect medicines and promptly seek medical advice. Angioedema has been reported"}

Suicide behaviour and ideation Patients treated with SAXENDA should be monitored for the emergence of depression, suicide thoughts or behaviour, or any unusual changes in mood or behaviour. Discontinue SAXENDA in patients who experience suicidal thoughts or behaviours or who develop other symptoms of depression [see section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable effects)]. Patients with a history of major depressive disorder or other major psychiatric disorder were excluded from the SAXENDA clinical trials. Because of the lack of data on efficacy and safety in patients with a history of major depressive disorder or other major psychiatric disorder, SAXENDA is not recommended in these patients. Effects on laboratory tests No data available. 4.5 Interaction with Other Medicines and Other Forms of Interactions No clinically significant drug interactions have been demonstrated with SAXENDA. In vitro assessment of drug-drug interaction Liraglutide has very low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding.

Saxenda® Product Information – VV-LAB-097235 Page 6 of 27 In vivo assessment of drug-drug interaction The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. The effect on rate of gastric emptying (paracetamol AUC0-5h) was equivalent between liraglutide 1.8 mg and 3.0 mg [see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties]. Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that Cmax of liraglutide (8-12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs. Oral Medications The delay of gastric emptying caused by liraglutide may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. Interaction studies did not show any clinically relevant delay of absorption of the compounds that were studied, however clinically relevant interactions with other compounds where the effect is dependent on Cmax and tmax, drugs with narrow therapeutic index, or medications associated with local gastrointestinal irritation (e.g. bisphosphonates, potassium chloride) cannot be excluded. Few patients treated with liraglutide reported at least one episode of severe diarrhoea. Diarrhoea may affect the absorption of concomitant oral medicinal products. Paracetamol Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of paracetamol following a single dose of paracetamol 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Paracetamol Cmax was decreased by 31% and median tmax was delayed up to 15 min. No"}

Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median tmax was delayed from 1 hour to 3 hours with liraglutide. Therefore, no dose adjustment of atorvastatin is required when given with liraglutide. Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co- administration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide at steady state. Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median tmax did not change. Dose adjustments of griseofulvin and other compounds with low solubility and high permeability are not required. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. The concomitant administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; Cmax decreased by 31%.

Saxenda® Product Information – VV-LAB-097235 Page 7 of 27 Oral contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state. Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12 and 13%, respectively. tmax was delayed by 1.5 hours with liraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol. Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC0-∞ by 18%. The contraceptive effect is therefore anticipated to be unaffected when co-administered with liraglutide. Warfarin and other coumarin derivatives No interaction study has been performed.

Insulin No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Units/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered in patients with type 2 diabetes. 4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation Effects on fertility No adverse effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats given subcutaneous doses of liraglutide at ≤1mg/kg/day, yielding exposure to liraglutide (plasma AUC) 12-14 times higher than that of patients at the maximum recommended human dose. Use in pregnancy Pregnancy Category: B3 Increased embryofetal death and minor fetal skeletal abnormalities (kinked ribs) were observed in rats given liraglutide at 1mg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection (yielding 12-times the plasma AUC in humans at the maximum recommended clinical dose). In rabbits treated at doses ≥0.01mg/kg/day (relative exposure, ≥0.2), there was retardation of fetal growth and an increased incidence of several minor skeletal and visceral abnormalities.

If a patient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, treatment with SAXENDA should be discontinued. Use in lactation It is not known whether liraglutide is excreted in human milk. Studies in lactating rats have shown that the transfer of liraglutide and metabolites of close structural relationship into milk is low. Non-clinical studies have shown a treatment related reduction of neonatal growth in suckling rat pups. Due to lack of experience, SAXENDA must not be used during breast- feeding.

The hazard ratio and 95% CI was 0.33 [0.12; 0.90] for Saxenda versus placebo. Favourable trends for cardiovascular disease in pre-market trials (that were not powered for this endpoint and who enrolled low-risk patients) did not necessarily provide reassurance of cardiovascular safety.

Liraglutide significantly reduced the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events, MACE) vs. placebo (3.41 vs. 3.90 per 100 patient years of observation in the liraglutide and placebo groups, respectively) with a risk reduction of 13%. Cardiac conduction disorders and PR interval prolongation A prolongation of the mean PR interval of up to 10 ms was reported with SAXENDA treatment in a clinical trial in healthy volunteers, using lower doses than recommended for weight management. In SAXENDA clinical trials, the incidence of cardiac conduction disorders (e.g., first degree atrioventricular [AV] block) was higher with SAXENDA than placebo; 11 (0.3%) of 3384 SAXENDA-treated patients compared with none of the 1941 placebo-treated patients had a cardiac conduction disorder [see section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use, Cardiac conduction disorders].

The majority of events were mild. Hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes In a clinical trial in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with SAXENDA in combination with diet and exercise, hypoglycaemic events were accompanied by blood glucose measurements and classified accordingly. Severe hypoglycaemia (requiring third party assistance) was reported by 0.7% of patients treated with SAXENDA and only in patients concomitantly treated with sulfonylurea. Also, in these patients documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (defined as plasma glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L accompanied by symptoms) was reported by 43.6% of patients treated with SAXENDA and in 27.3% of patients treated with placebo. Among patients not concomitantly treated with sulfonylurea, 15.7% of patients treated with SAXENDA and 7.6% of patients treated with placebo reported documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic events. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions In SAXENDA clinical trials, 68% of SAXENDA-treated patients and 39% of placebo-treated patients reported gastrointestinal disorders; the most frequently reported was nausea (39% versus 14%). The percentage of patients reporting nausea declined as treatment continued. Other common adverse reactions that occurred at higher incidence among SAXENDA-treated patients included diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dry mouth, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux, flatulence, eructation, and abdominal distension.

Malignancy Breast cancer In SAXENDA clinical trials, breast cancer confirmed by adjudication was reported in 17 (0.7%) of 2379 SAXENDA-treated women compared with 3 (0.2%) of 1300 placebo-treated women, including invasive cancer (13 SAXENDA-treated versus 2 placebo-treated women) and ductal carcinoma in situ (4 versus 1). The majority of cancers were estrogen- and progesterone-receptor positive. There were too few cases to determine whether these cases were related to SAXENDA.

Allergic reactions Few cases of anaphylactic reactions with symptoms such as hypotension, palpitations, dyspnoea or oedema have been reported with marketed use of liraglutide. Anaphylactic reactions may potentially be life threatening. Suicidal behaviour and ideation In the SAXENDA clinical trials, 9 (0.3%) of 3384 SAXENDA-treated patients and 2 (0.1%) of the 1941 placebo-treated patients reported suicide ideation; one of the SAXENDA-treated patients attempted suicide [See section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use].

Because clinical evaluation to exclude alternative causes of ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increases was not done in most cases, the relationship to SAXENDA is uncertain. Some increases in ALT and AST were associated with other confounding factors (such as gallstones). Serum Calcitonin Calcitonin, a biological marker of MTC, was measured throughout the clinical development program [see section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use]. More patients treated with SAXENDA in the clinical trials were observed to have high calcitonin values during treatment, compared with placebo. The proportion of patients with calcitonin greater than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of normal at the end of the trial was 1.2% in SAXENDA-treated patients and 0.6% in placebo-treated patients. Calcitonin values greater than 20 ng/L at the end of the trial occurred in 0.5% of SAXENDA-treated patients and 0.2% of placebo-treated patients; among patients with pre- treatment serum calcitonin less than 20 ng/L, none had calcitonin elevations to greater than 50 ng/L at the end of the trial.

From clinical trials and post-market use of liraglutide, deliberate or accidental administration of doses up to 24 times the recommended maintenance dose (72 mg) have been reported, including one case of a 6-fold overdose (18 mg daily) given for 7 months. These included instances where patients needed hospitalisation either due to severe events of vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea, or as a precaution. In some reports glucose infusion was administered. Severe hypoglycaemia has also been observed. All patients were reported to have recovered from the events without complications.

The patient should be observed for clinical signs of dehydration and blood glucose should be monitored. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties Mechanism of action Liraglutide is an acylated human GLP-1 analogue with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1. Like endogenous GLP-1, liraglutide binds to and activates the GLP-1R. Liraglutide is relatively stable against metabolic degradation and has a plasma half- life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration. Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide has a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile in humans suitable for once daily administration. Following subcutaneous administration, the protracted action profile is based on three mechanisms: self-association (which results in slow absorption), binding to albumin and enzymatic stability towards the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP- IV) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) enzymes, resulting in a long plasma half-life. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake and GLP-1R is present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation as well as the intestine. In animal studies, peripheral administration of liraglutide led to uptake in specific brain regions including the hypothalamus, where liraglutide, via specific activation of the GLP-1R, increased key satiety and decreased key hunger signals. Transient inhibition of gastric emptying was also observed. GLP-1 receptors are also expressed in specific locations in the heart, vasculature, immune system, and kidneys. In mouse models of atherosclerosis liraglutide prevented aortic plaque progression and reduced the expression of genes related to inflammation in aortic tissue. In addition, liraglutide had a beneficial"}

GLP-1 receptors are also expressed in specific locations in the heart, vasculature, immune system, and kidneys. In mouse models of atherosclerosis liraglutide prevented aortic plaque progression and reduced the expression of genes related to inflammation in aortic tissue. In addition, liraglutide had a beneficial effect on plasma lipids, decreasing plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL and VLDL, and increasing HDL. Liraglutide did not reduce the plaque size of already established plaques. Liraglutide lowers body weight through decreased food intake and loss of predominantly fat mass. Liraglutide does not increase 24-hour energy expenditure. Liraglutide affects the four main components of appetite. Liraglutide regulates appetite by increasing feelings of fullness and satiety, while lowering feelings of hunger and prospective food consumption. Liraglutide also has effects on glucose homeostasis, resulting in lowering of fasting and post- prandial glucose. Liraglutide stimulates insulin secretion, lowers inappropriately high glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and improves beta-cell function. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also may involve a minor delay in gastric emptying. [see section 4.5 Interaction with Other Medicines and Other Form of Interactions].

At week 0 patients were randomised to receive either SAXENDA or placebo. Concomitant medication SAXENDA was more likely than placebo to reduce the use of antihypertensive and lipid lowering drugs after one year of treatment and in patients with type 2 diabetes, SAXENDA was also more likely than placebo to reduce the use of oral antidiabetic drugs after one year of treatment. Patient reported outcomes SAXENDA improved several patient reported outcomes compared to placebo. Significant improvements were seen in the IWQoL-Lite total score (SCALE-Obesity and Pre-diabetes and SCALE-Diabetes) and in all domains of the SF-36 (SCALE-Obesity and Pre-diabetes), indicating favourable effects on physical function and mental health.

Distribution of weight loss In a sub-study of obese (BMI 30-40 kg/m2), non-diabetic patients, DEXA analysis and CT scans were performed at baseline and at Week 20 for 15 patients on SAXENDA and 14 patients on placebo. In the sub-study, weight loss was predominantly from fat mass rather than from lean body mass for both treatment groups. Mean visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue area was reduced after 20 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. Moreover, with SAXENDA, relative reductions in visceral fat were greater than in subcutaneous fat.

Appetite sensations, calorie intake, and energy expenditure The weight loss effect of liraglutide is considered to be mediated by regulation of appetite and food intake. Appetite sensations were assessed before and up to five hours after a standardised breakfast meal, and ad libitum food intake was assessed during the subsequent lunch meal. Compared to placebo, SAXENDA increased post-prandial satiety and fullness ratings, reduced hunger and prospective food consumption ratings and decreased ad libitum food intake.

Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) In a cardiac repolarisation study, liraglutide at steady state concentrations with daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation. The liraglutide exposure for overweight and obese subjects treated with SAXENDA is comparable to the exposure evaluated in the liraglutide QTc study. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties Absorption The absorption of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is slow, reaching maximum concentration approximately 11 hours post dosing. The average steady state concentration of liraglutide (AUCτ/24) reached approximately 31 nmol/L in obese (BMI 30-40 kg/m2) subjects following administration of liraglutide 3.0 mg. Liraglutide exposure increased proportionally with dose in the dose range of 0.6 to 3.0 mg. SAXENDA can be administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of a liraglutide 3.0 mg is 20-25 L (for a person weighing approximately 100 kg). The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide is 0.07 L/kg. Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%). Metabolism/biotransformation During the 24 hours following administration of a single [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide.

Following a [3H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or faeces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or faeces (6% and 5%, respectively). The urine and faeces radioactivity was mainly excreted during the first 6-8 days, and corresponded to three minor metabolites. The apparent clearance following sub-cutaneous administration of liraglutide 3.0 mg is approximately 0.9-1.4 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours.

Body weight The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. The 3.0 mg daily dose of liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposure over the body weight range of 60-234 kg evaluated for exposure response in the clinical trial. Liraglutide exposure was not studied in subjects with body weight >234 kg. Hepatic impairment The pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment in a single-dose trial (0.75 mg). Liraglutide exposure was decreased by 23% and 13% in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment respectively, compared to healthy subjects. Exposure was significantly lower (44%) in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score >9).

Due to limited clinical experience in patients with hepatic impairment, QTERN should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see Section 4.2 Dose and Method of Administration and Section 5 Pharmacological Properties).

Use in patients at risk for volume depletion and or hypotension The diuretic effect of dapagliflozin is a potential concern for volume depleted patients. Due to its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin induces osmotic diuresis which may lead to the modest decrease in blood pressure observed in clinical studies (see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties – Clinical trials). When considering initiating QTERN, there may be patients for whom the additional diuretic effect of dapagliflozin is a potential concern either due to acute illness (such as gastrointestinal illness) or a history of hypotension or dehydration with diuretic therapy for patients who may become volume depleted. Initiation of therapy with QTERN is therefore not recommended in these patients. In case of intercurrent conditions that may lead to volume depletion, such as gastrointestinal illness, heat stress or severe infections, careful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including electrolytes is recommended). Temporary interruption of QTERN is recommended for patients who develop volume depletion until the depletion is corrected (see Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects)). Caution should be exercised in patients for whom a dapagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could pose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on antihypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension or elderly patients.

Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia if used in combination with QTERN (see Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects)). Hypersensitivity reactions During postmarketing experience the following adverse reactions have been reported with use of saxagliptin: serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction to saxagliptin is suspected, discontinue QTERN, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. (See Section 4.3 Contraindications and Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects.) Pancreatitis During postmarketing experience with saxagliptin, there have been spontaneously reported adverse reactions of acute pancreatitis. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute 3 of 35 pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is suspected, QTERN should be discontinued.

(See 4.8 Section Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects)) Ketoacidosis QTERN should not be used for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). There have been reports of ketoacidosis, including DKA, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalisation, in patients taking dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors. Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking dapagliflozin. Patients treated with QTERN who present with signs and symptoms consistent with ketoacidosis, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise and shortness of breath, should be assessed for ketoacidosis, even if blood glucose levels are below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). If ketoacidosis is suspected, QTERN should be suspended, the patient should be evaluated and prompt treatment initiated. Treatment of ketoacidosis generally requires insulin, fluid, potassium and carbohydrate replacement. Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is not recommended unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved. Before initiating QTERN, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis Factors that predispose patients to ketoacidosis include insulin deficiency from any cause (including insulin pump failure, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), insulin dose reduction, reduced caloric intake or increased insulin requirements due to infections, low carbohydrate diet, acute illness, surgery, a previous ketoacidosis, dehydration and alcohol abuse.

QTERN should be used with caution in these patients. Consider monitoring patients for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing QTERN in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. Surgery Treatment with QTERN should be ceased prior to major surgery. An increase in other glucose lowering agents may be required during this time. Patients scheduled for non-urgent surgery who have not ceased dapagliflozin should be assessed and consideration should be given to postponing the procedure. Treatment with QTERN may be restarted once the patient’s condition has stabilised and oral intake is normal. Urinary tract infections There have been post-marketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalisation in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Urinary tract infections were more frequently reported for dapagliflozin 10 mg compared to control in a placebo-pooled analysis up to 24 weeks (4.7% vs. 3.5%, respectively).

Discontinuation of QTERN may be considered in cases of recurrent urinary tract infections; see Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects). Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene) Postmarketing cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier’s gangrene), a rare, but serious and potentially life-threatening necrotising infection, have been reported in female and male patients with diabetes mellitus treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin [see section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)]. Serious outcomes have included hospitalisation, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with QTERN who present with pain or tenderness, erythema, swelling in the genital or perineal area, fever, malaise should be evaluated for necrotising fasciitis. If suspected, QTERN should be discontinued and prompt treatment should be instituted (including broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement if necessary). Skin disorders Ulcerative and necrotic skin lesions have been reported in extremities of monkeys in non-clinical toxicology studies with saxagliptin. Although skin lesions were not observed at an increased incidence in clinical trials, there is limited experience in patients with diabetic skin complications.

Bullous pemphigoid Post-marketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalisation have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving QTERN. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, QTERN should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment (see Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects)). Cardiac failure Saxagliptin Experience in NYHA class III-IV is still limited. In the SAVOR trial a small increase in the rate for hospitalisation for heart failure was observed in the saxagliptin treated patients compared to placebo, although a causal relationship has not been established. Additional analysis did not indicate a differential effect among NYHA classes. (See Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects) – Cardiovascular safety).

Patients experienced relief of symptoms after discontinuation of the medication and some experienced recurrence of symptoms with reintroduction of the same or another DPP4 inhibitor. Onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy may be rapid or may occur after longer periods of treatment. If a patient presents with severe joint pain, continuation of drug therapy should be individually assessed. (See Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects)).

It is important to regularly examine the feet and counsel all patients with diabetes on routine preventative footcare. Use in the elderly Saxagliptin Saxagliptin and its major metabolite are eliminated in part by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in the elderly based on renal function. (See Sections 4.2 Dose and Method of Administration) Dapagliflozin No dosage adjustment for dapagliflozin is required based on age (see Section 4.2 Dose and administration). Older patients may be at greater risk of volume depletion and are more likely to have impaired renal function. The renal function recommendations provided for all patients also apply to elderly patients (see Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use). Paediatric use Safety and effectiveness of QTERN in paediatric patients have not been established. Delayed growth and metabolic acidosis in rats were observed in both sexes at higher doses of dapagliflozin (greater than or equal to 15 mg/kg/day).

From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2.2 x 109 c/L, a mean decrease of approximately 0.1 x 109 c/L relative to placebo was observed in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical studies. Mean absolute lymphocyte counts remained stable and within the normal limits with daily dosing up to 102 weeks in duration. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. In the SAVOR trial, decreased lymphocyte counts were reported in 0.5% of saxagliptin-treated patients and 0.4% of placebo-treated patients. Dapagliflozin Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors.

In placebo-controlled studies with long-term data, at Week 102, results for haematocrit values >55% were similar to Week 24. Most patients with marked abnormalities of elevated haematocrit or haemoglobin had elevations measured a single time that resolved at subsequent visits. Serum Inorganic Phosphorus In short-term placebo-controlled studies, higher proportions of patients with marked laboratory abnormalities of hyperphosphataemia were reported on dapagliflozin at Week-24 (0.9% versus 1.7% for placebo and dapagliflozin 10 mg, respectively).

Lipids Data from the saxagliptin and dapagliflozin plus metformin treatment arms of three Phase 3 trials, demonstrated trends of mean percent increases from baseline in total cholesterol, (ranging from 0.4% to 3.8%), LDL cholesterol (ranging from 2.1% to 6.9 %), and HDL cholesterol (ranging 2.3% to 5.2%) along with mean percent decreases from baseline in triglycerides (ranging from -3.0% to - 10.8%).

No dose adjustment of either saxagliptin or dapagliflozin is needed when the two drugs are co administered either separately or as the QTERN fixed-dose combination. See saxagliptin and dapagliflozin subsections for drug interactions. In summary, there are no clinically meaningful drug interactions expected for either saxagliptin or dapagliflozin or the QTERN fixed-dose combination. Saxagliptin The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) which converts it to an active metabolite. Therefore, drugs which inhibit the activity of this enzyme system may increase plasma concentrations of saxagliptin but reduce those of its metabolite, whereas CYP3A inducers will tend to do the opposite. However, the overall biological effect of saxagliptin is unaffected by coadministration with"}

Therefore, drugs which inhibit the activity of this enzyme system may increase plasma concentrations of saxagliptin but reduce those of its metabolite, whereas CYP3A inducers will tend to do the opposite. However, the overall biological effect of saxagliptin is unaffected by coadministration with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5. In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its major metabolite neither inhibited CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4, nor inhibited UGT1A9. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolised by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is neither a significant inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) nor an inducer of P-gp. The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its major metabolite in human serum is below measurable levels. Thus, protein binding would not have a meaningful influence on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin or other drugs. In studies conducted in healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin, its major metabolite, were altered by some drugs which affect the CYP3A4/5 system. However, total exposure to the total active components of saxagliptin (parent+metabolite), were not meaningfully altered by metformin, glibenclamide, pioglitazone, digoxin, simvastatin, diltiazem, ketoconazole, rifampicin, omeprazole, aluminum hydroxide+magnesium hydroxide+simethicone combination, or famotidine. Saxagliptin also did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glibenclamide, pioglitazone, digoxin, simvastatin, diltiazem, ketoconazole or an estrogen/progestin combined oral contraceptive.

Saxagliptin also did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glibenclamide, pioglitazone, digoxin, simvastatin, diltiazem, ketoconazole or an estrogen/progestin combined oral contraceptive. Other interactions The effects of smoking, diet, herbal products, and alcohol use on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin have not been specifically studied. The safety and efficacy of saxagliptin in combination with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors or orlistat has not been established. Dapagliflozin The metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily mediated by UGT1A9-dependent glucuronide conjugation. The major metabolite, dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, is not an SGLT2 inhibitor. In in vitro studies, dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide neither inhibited CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, 2B6 or 3A4. Therefore, dapagliflozin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are 8 of 35 metabolised by these enzymes, and drugs that inhibit or induce these enzymes are not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin is a weak substrate of the P- glycoprotein (P-gp) active transporter and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is a substrate for the OAT3 active transporter. Dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide did not meaningfully inhibit P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 active transporters. Overall, dapagliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered medications that are P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 substrates. In interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly single dose design, the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin were not altered by metformin (an hOCT-1 and hOCT-2 substrate), pioglitazone (a CYP2C8 [major] and CYP3A4 [minor] substrate), sitagliptin (an hOAT-"}

Therefore, meaningful interaction of dapagliflozin with other substrates of hOCT-1, hOCT-2, hOAT-3, P-gp, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and other α-glucosidase inhibitors would not be expected. Dapagliflozin also did not alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepiride, hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, simvastatin, digoxin (a P-gp substrate), or warfarin (S-warfarin is a CYP2C substrate). Therefore, dapagliflozin is not a clinical meaningful inhibitor of hOCT-1, hOCT-2, hOAT-3, P-gp transporter pathway, and CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 mediated metabolism. Concomitant use of dapagliflozin and lithium may lead to a reduction in serum lithium concentrations due to a possible increased urinary clearance of lithium. The dose of lithium may need to be adjusted. Following coadministration of dapagliflozin with rifampicin (an inducer of various active transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes) or mefenamic acid (an inhibitor of UGT1A9), a 22% decrease and a 51% increase, respectively, in dapagliflozin systemic exposure was seen, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24-hour urinary glucose excretion in either case.

Saxagliptin In a rat fertility study, males were treated with oral gavage doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day for two weeks prior to mating, during mating, and up to scheduled termination (approximately four weeks total) and females were treated with oral gavage doses of 125, 300, and 750 mg/kg/day for two weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effects on fertility were observed at 200 mg/kg/day (males) or 125 mg/kg/day (females) resulting in respective exposures (AUC) of approximately 670 (males) and 865 (females) times human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. At higher, maternally toxic doses (300 and 750 mg/kg/day), increased foetal resorptions were observed (approximately 2300 and 6810 times the recommended clinical dose).

In conventional studies of embryofoetal development in rats and rabbits, dapagliflozin was administered for intervals coinciding with the period of organogenesis in humans. An increased incidence of embryofoetal lethality, decreased foetal weight and an increased incidence of foetal visceral and skeletal anomalies were seen in rats at maternotoxic doses (oral doses greater than or equal to 150 mg/kg/day). The no observed effect level for embryofoetal effects in rats was an oral dose of 75 mg/kg/day (1530 times the exposure in patients at the maximum recommended human 10 of 35 dose [MRHD]).

Direct and indirect exposure of dapagliflozin to weanling juvenile rats and during late pregnancy are each associated with increased incidence and/or severity of renal pelvic and tubular dilatations in progeny, although the long-term functional consequences of these effects are unknown. These periods of exposure coincide with a critical window of renal maturation in rats. As functional maturation of the kidneys in humans continues in the first 2 years of life, dapagliflozin-associated dilated renal pelvis and tubules noted in juvenile rats could constitute potential risk for human renal maturation during the first 2 years of life. Additionally, the negative effects on body-weight gain associated with lactational exposure in weanling juvenile rats suggest that dapagliflozin must be avoided during the first 2 years of life. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, when driving or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness has been reported with saxagliptin.

Clinical trials Saxagliptin/dapagliflozin fixed-dose combination has been demonstrated to be bioequivalent with co-administered saxagliptin and dapagliflozin. In therapeutic clinical trials, saxagliptin and dapagliflozin were administered as individual tablets. The safety of combined use of 5 mg saxagliptin and 10 mg dapagliflozin has been evaluated in 1169 adult subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in an integrated safety pool of three phase 3 active/placebo controlled short-term and long-term clinical trials for up to 52 weeks. The median exposure for the saxagliptin and dapagliflozin plus metformin group was 359 days. At least 235 subjects in the saxagliptin and dapagliflozin plus metformin group received saxagliptin/dapagliflozin for >360 days. The pooled safety analysis is comprised of 3 treatment groups: saxagliptin and dapagliflozin plus metformin (492 subjects; data pooled from the concomitant therapy with saxagliptin and dapagliflozin study and the 2 sequential combination use studies); saxagliptin plus metformin (336 subjects data pooled from the concomitant therapy with saxagliptin and dapagliflozin and the dapagliflozin added to saxagliptin and metformin studies); and dapagliflozin plus metformin (341 subjects data pooled from the concomitant therapy with saxagliptin and dapagliflozin and the saxagliptin added to dapagliflozin"}

Trials did not include patients with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2. In this patient population the safety results demonstrated that the combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin plus metformin is well tolerated and is consistent with the known safety profiles for the pooled safety analysis of saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg combination plus metformin, and its monocomponents. Diabetic ketoacidosis was identified with a frequency of rare ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), based on annual rate, in a large cardiovascular outcomes study with dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Description of selected adverse events The information below provides additional information regarding adverse events reported for the saxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination.

Precipitating factors for DKA were as expected in a type 2 diabetes mellitus population (see Section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use). Volume depletion Events related to volume depletion (hypotension, dehydration, and hypovolemia) were reflective of the adverse events with dapagliflozin and were reported in two subjects (0.4%) in the saxagliptin and dapagliflozin plus metformin group (SAE of syncope and an adverse event of urine output decreased), and 3 subjects (0.9%) in the dapagliflozin plus metformin group (2 adverse events of syncope and 1 of hypotension). Events Related to Decreased Renal Function Use of dapagliflozin was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR. These changes were observed to reverse after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute haemodynamic changes play a role in the renal function abnormalities observed with dapagliflozin.

Vital signs Mean change from baseline in the heart rates across the 3 treatment groups were similar. Consistent with its mild diuretic effects, the dapagliflozin-containing treatments were associated with decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The small effects on blood pressure were consistent over time. A similar proportion of subjects in each of the three treatment groups achieved systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure <80 mmHg. Peripheral Oedema Saxagliptin In a saxagliptin add-on to TZD study, the incidence of peripheral oedema was higher for saxagliptin 5 mg plus TZD versus placebo plus TZD (8.1% versus 4.3%).

In the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated as dictated by the patient’s clinical status. Saxagliptin and its major metabolite are removed by haemodialysis (23% of dose over four hours). The removal of dapagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied. For information on the management of overdose, contact the Poisons Information Centre on 131126 (Australia). 5 5.1 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Mechanism of action QTERN combines saxagliptin and dapagliflozin with distinct and complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control. Saxagliptin, through the selective inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), enhances glucose-mediated insulin secretion (incretin effect). Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), inhibits renal glucose reabsorption independently of insulin. Actions of both drugs are regulated by the plasma glucose level. The combination of both agents delivers clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c for improved glycaemic control in patients with T2DM.

While saxagliptin has a neutral effect on weight, urinary glucose excretion (glucuresis) induced by dapagliflozin is associated with caloric and weight loss. Saxagliptin Saxagliptin is a member of a class of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents called DPP-4 inhibitors. Saxagliptin is a reversible, competitive, DPP-4 inhibitor with nanomolar potency. Saxagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 versus other DPP enzymes, with greater than 75 fold selectivity over DPP-8 and DPP-9. Saxagliptin has extended binding to the DPP-4 active site, prolonging its inhibition of DPP-4. Saxagliptin exerts its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose- dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Concentrations of these active intact incretin hormones are increased by saxagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the actions of these hormones. 16 of 35 Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin is a reversible competitive inhibitor of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) with nanomolar potency that improves glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and provides cardio renal benefits. Inhibition of SGLT2 by dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate in the proximal renal tubule with a concomitant reduction in sodium reabsorption leading to urinary excretion of glucose and osmotic diuresis. Dapagliflozin therefore increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule which is believed to increase tubuloglomerular feedback and reduce intraglomerular pressure. Secondary effects of SGLT2 inhibition with dapagliflozin also include a modest reduction in blood pressure, reduction in body weight, and an increase"}

Secondary effects of SGLT2 inhibition with dapagliflozin also include a modest reduction in blood pressure, reduction in body weight, and an increase in haematocrit. The cardio-renal benefits of dapagliflozin are not solely dependent on the blood glucose lowering effect and not limited to patients with diabetes. In addition to the osmotic diuretic and related hemodynamic actions of SGLT2 inhibition, potential secondary effects on myocardial metabolism, ion channels, fibrosis, adipokines and uric acid may be mechanisms underlying the cardio-renal beneficial effects of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels by reducing renal glucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion. This glucose excretion (glucuretic effect) is observed after the first dose, is continuous over the 24 hour dosing interval, and is sustained for the duration of treatment. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this mechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and GFR. Thus, in subjects with normal glucose, dapagliflozin has a low propensity to cause hypoglycaemia. Dapagliflozin does not impair normal endogenous glucose production in response to hypoglycaemia. Dapagliflozin acts independently of insulin secretion and insulin action. Over time, improvement in beta cell function (HOMA-2) has been observed in clinical studies with dapagliflozin.

The majority of the weight reduction was body fat loss, including visceral fat rather than lean tissue or fluid loss as demonstrated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and magnetic resonance imaging. SGLT2 is selectively expressed in the kidney. Dapagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters important for glucose transport into peripheral tissues and is approximately 1000-3000 times more selective for SGLT2 vs. SGLT1, the major transporter in the gut responsible for glucose absorption. Pharmacodynamic effects Saxagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes, administration of saxagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent beta-cell responsiveness, which resulted in higher insulin and C peptide concentrations. The rise in insulin and the decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Dapagliflozin Increases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin.

Urinary volume increases in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg were sustained at 12 weeks and amounted to approximately 375 mL/day. The increase in urinary volume was associated with a small and transient increase in urinary sodium excretion that was not associated with changes in serum sodium concentrations. Urinary uric acid excretion was also increased transiently (for 3-7 days) and accompanied by a reduction in serum uric acid concentration. At 24 weeks, reductions in serum uric acid concentrations ranged from 18.3 to 48.3 μmol/L.

Administration of QTERN with a high-fat meal decreases dapagliflozin Cmax by up to 47% and prolongs Tmax by approximately 2 hours, but does not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There was no food effect observed for saxagliptin. QTERN can be administered with or without food. Saxagliptin The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin have been extensively characterised in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. Saxagliptin was rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with maximum saxagliptin plasma concentrations (Cmax) usually attained within two hours after administration in the fasted state.

Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC(INF) values for saxagliptin and its major metabolite were 78 ng•h/mL and 214 ng•h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma Cmax values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The intra-subject coefficients of variation for saxagliptin Cmax and AUC were less than 12%. Following a single oral dose of 5 mg saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half- life (t1/2) for saxagliptin was 2.5 hours and the mean t1/2 value for plasma DPP-4 inhibition was 26.9 hours. The inhibition of plasma DPP-4 activity by saxagliptin for at least 24 hours after oral administration of saxagliptin is due to high potency, high affinity, and extended binding to the active site. No appreciable accumulation was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence was observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its major metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 400 mg.

These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Distribution Saxagliptin The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its major metabolite in human serum is below measurable levels. Thus, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin is approximately 91% protein bound. Protein binding is not altered in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment). 28 of 35 Metabolism Saxagliptin The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a selective, reversible, competitive DPP-4 inhibitor, half as potent as saxagliptin. Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin is extensively metabolised, primarily to yield dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, with a molar plasma AUC 52% higher than that of dapagliflozin itself at the clinical dose, is an inactive metabolite and does not contribute to the glucose lowering effects. The formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is mediated by UGT1A9, an enzyme present in the liver and kidney, and CYP mediated metabolism was a minor clearance pathway in humans. Excretion Saxagliptin Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its major metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively."}

The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. For the major metabolite, renal clearance values were comparable to estimated glomerular filtration rate. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin and related metabolites are primarily eliminated via urinary excretion, of which less than 2% is unchanged dapagliflozin. After oral administration of 50 mg [14C] dapagliflozin dose, 96% was recovered, 75% in urine and 21% in faeces. In faeces, approximately 15% of the dose was excreted as parent drug.

The study included patients with renal impairment classified on the basis of creatinine clearance as mild (>50 to ≤80 mL/min), moderate (30 to ≤50 mL/min), and severe (<30 mL/min), as well as patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis.

In subjects with CrCL>50 mL/min (approximately corresponding to eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 by MDRD eGFR equation, following post-hoc re-analysis), the AUC values of saxagliptin and its major metabolite were 1.2- and 1.7-fold higher, respectively, than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Increases of this magnitude are not clinically relevant, therefore dosage adjustment in these patients is not recommended. In subjects with renal impairment with CrCL≤50 mL/min (approximately corresponding to eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, following post-hoc re-analysis) or in subjects with ESRD on haemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin and its major metabolite were up to 2.1- and 4.5-fold higher, respectively, than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function.

At dapagliflozin 20 mg once-daily, higher systemic exposure to dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal impairment did not result in a correspondingly higher renal glucose clearance or 24 hour glucose excretion. The renal glucose clearance and 24 hour glucose excretion were lower in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment as compared to patients with normal and mild renal impairment. The steady-state 24-h urinary glucose excretion was highly dependent on renal function and 85, 52, 18 and 11 g of glucose/day was excreted by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function or mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, respectively.

Saxagliptin Elderly subjects (65-80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean Cmax and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for parent saxagliptin than young subjects (18-40 years). Differences in major metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in parent saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the major metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely to be due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age.

Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking empagliflozin. Patients treated with GLYXAMBI who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels as ketoacidosis associated with GLYXAMBI may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 13.8 mmol/L. Signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis may include excessive thirst, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalised malaise, and shortness of breath. If ketoacidosis is suspected, GLYXAMBI should be discontinued, the patient should be evaluated and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis generally requires insulin, fluid, potassium and carbohydrate replacement. Diabetic ketoacidosis and glucosuria may be prolonged after discontinuation of GLYXAMBI in some patients, i.e. it may last longer than expected from 5 plasma half-lives of empagliflozin (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 2 Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous DKA while on SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved. Before initiating GLYXAMBI, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis. Factors that predispose patients to ketoacidosis include a low carbohydrate diet , dehydration, acute illness, surgery, a previous ketoacidosis, insulin deficiency from any cause (including insulin pump failure, history of pancreatitis, or pancreatic surgery), malnourishment/reduced caloric intake or increased insulin requirements due to infections, and alcohol abuse.

GLYXAMBI should be used with caution in these patients. When reducing the insulin dose in patients requiring insulin, caution should be taken (see Section 4.2 Dose and method of temporarily discontinuing administration). Consider monitoring GLYXAMBI in clinical situations known to predispose ketoacidosis. In these situations, consider monitoring of ketones, even if GLYXAMBI treatment has been interrupted. for ketoacidosis and Surgery Treatment with GLYXAMBI should be ceased prior to major surgery. An increase in other glucose lowering agents may be required during this time. Patients scheduled for non-urgent surgery who have not ceased empagliflozin should be assessed and consideration should be given to postponing the procedure. Treatment with GLYXAMBI may be restarted once the patient's condition has stabilised and oral intake is normal. Hypoglycaemia In clinical trials of linagliptin or of empagliflozin as part of combination therapy with agents not known to cause hypoglycaemia (e.g. metformin, thiazolidinediones) rates of hypoglycaemia reported with linagliptin or empagliflozin were similar to rates in patients taking placebo (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)).

A dose reduction of the sulfonylurea or insulin may be considered. Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been observed in patients taking linagliptin (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). If pancreatitis is suspected, GLYXAMBI should be discontinued. Use in patients at risk for volume depletion Based on the mode of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, osmotic diuresis accompanying therapeutic glucosuria may lead to a modest decrease in BP. Therefore, caution should be exercised in patients for whom an empagliflozin-induced drop in BP could pose a risk, such as patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension or patients aged 75 years and older. In case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of volume status (e.g. physical examination, BP measurements, laboratory tests including haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving empagliflozin. Temporary interruption of treatment with GLYXAMBI should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected. Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalisation in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 3 empagliflozin.

Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Discontinuation of empagliflozin may be considered in cases of recurrent urinary tract infections. Genital infections including life threatening necrotising fasciitis Cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier’s gangrene), a rare, but serious and life-threatening necrotising infection, have been reported in female and male patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Serious outcomes have included hospitalisation, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with GLYXAMBI who present with pain or tenderness, erythema, swelling in the genital or perineal area, fever, malaise should be evaluated for necrotising fasciitis. If suspected, GLYXAMBI should be discontinued and prompt treatment should be instituted (including broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement if necessary). Lower limb amputations An increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in a long-term clinical study with another SGLT2 inhibitor. The medicine in that study is not empagliflozin. However, it is unknown whether this constitutes a class effect. In a pooled safety analysis of 12,620 patients with T2DM the frequency of patients with lower limb amputations was similar between empagliflozin and placebo.

It is important to regularly examine the feet and counsel all diabetic patients on routine preventative footcare. Bullous pemphigoid Bullous pemphigoid has been observed in patients taking linagliptin. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, GLYXAMBI should be discontinued. Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of joint pain, which may be severe, in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Onset of symptoms following initiation of treatment may be rapid or may occur after longer periods. Discontinuation of therapy should be considered in patients who present with or experience an exacerbation of joint symptoms during treatment with linagliptin. Combination with glucagon like peptide (GLP-1) analogues Linagliptin has not been studied in combination with glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues.

Use in renal impairment Empagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR (see Section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable Effects)). Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating empagliflozin. Patients with hypovolaemia may be more susceptible to these changes. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalisation and dialysis, in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age. GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 4 GLYXAMBI is contraindicated for use in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration – Patients with renal impairment and 4.3 Contraindications). Therapeutic experience with GLYXAMBI is limited in patients with eGFR <60 mL/min. Monitoring of renal function Due to its mechanism of action, the efficacy of empagliflozin is dependent on renal function. Therefore assessment of renal function is recommended: • prior to empagliflozin initiation and periodically during treatment, i.e. at least yearly; • prior to initiation of concomitant medicines that may reduce renal function and periodically thereafter. Patients treated with empagliflozin can experience an initial fall in eGFR. More intensive monitoring of renal function is recommended, particularly following treatment initiation, if empagliflozin is used in patients with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, especially if the eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2. GLYXAMBI should be discontinued when the eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or CrCl <30 mL/min (see Section 4.3 Contraindications).

Therapeutic experience in patients aged 75 years and older is limited. Initiation of therapy with GLYXAMBI in this population is not recommended. Paediatric use The safety and effectiveness of GLYXAMBI in children below 18 years of age have not been established. GLYXAMBI is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. Effect on laboratory tests Urine will test positive for glucose while patients are taking GLYXAMBI due to the nature of the mechanism of action of the SGLT2 inhibitors (see Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties). Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5- AG are unreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycaemic control. 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS No interactions between the two components of this fixed-dose combination have been observed in clinical studies.

Based on results of pharmacokinetic studies, no dose adjustment of GLYXAMBI is recommended when (see Section 5.1 co-administered with commonly prescribed medicinal products Pharmacodynamic properties), except those mentioned below. GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 5 Insulin and sulfonylureas: Insulin and sulfonylureas may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or sulfonylureas may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with GLYXAMBI (see Sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration, 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Diuretics: Empagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension (see Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). Lithium: Empagliflozin may increase renal lithium excretion and the blood lithium levels may be decreased. Serum concentration of lithium should be monitored more frequently after empagliflozin initiation and dose changes. Please refer the patient to the lithium prescribing doctor in order to monitor serum concentration of lithium. UGT inhibitors and inducers: Empagliflozin is primarily metabolised via UGT (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties); however, a clinically relevant effect of UGT inhibitors on empagliflozin is"}

UGT inhibitors and inducers: Empagliflozin is primarily metabolised via UGT (see Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties); however, a clinically relevant effect of UGT inhibitors on empagliflozin is not expected. Rifampicin: A study was conducted to assess the effect of rifampicin, a potent inductor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, on linagliptin. Multiple co-administration of linagliptin with rifampicin, resulted in a 39.6% and 43.8% decreased linagliptin steady-state AUC and Cmax and about 30% decreased DPP-4 inhibition at trough. Thus linagliptin in combination with strong P-glycoprotein inducers is expected to be clinically efficacious, although full efficacy might not be achieved. the pharmacokinetics of 5 mg Ritonavir: A study was conducted to assess the effect of ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of P- glycoprotein and CYP3A4, on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin. Co-administration of a single 5 mg oral dose of linagliptin and multiple 200 mg oral doses of ritonavir increased the AUC and Cmax of linagliptin approximately two-fold and three-fold, respectively. Simulations of steady-state plasma concentrations of linagliptin with and without ritonavir indicated that the increase in exposure will not be associated with an increased accumulation. These changes in linagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions would not be expected with other P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 inhibitors and dose adjustment is not required. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on fertility No studies on the effect on human"}

Animal studies conducted with empagliflozin alone and linagliptin alone do not indicate adverse effects on fertility in patients. Empagliflozin Studies in rats at doses of empagliflozin up to 700 mg/kg/day, do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility. In female rats this dose was 90- and 155-fold the systemic AUC exposure anticipated with a human dose of 10 and 25 mg. Linagliptin No adverse effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats given linagliptin orally up to the highest dose of 240 mg/kg/day (yielding approximately 1,000 times the plasma AUC obtained in patients at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 5 mg/day) prior to and throughout mating. GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 6 Use in pregnancy (Category D) There is a limited amount of data from the use of empagliflozin and linagliptin in pregnant women. It is recommended to avoid the use of GLYXAMBI during pregnancy unless clearly needed. In a study in pregnant rats, oral co-administration of 700 mg/kg empagliflozin and 140 mg/kg linagliptin during the period of organogenesis was associated with decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of minor fetal skeletal abnormalities,"}

In a study in pregnant rats, oral co-administration of 700 mg/kg empagliflozin and 140 mg/kg linagliptin during the period of organogenesis was associated with decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of minor fetal skeletal abnormalities, occurring in conjunction with maternotoxicity. No adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed with administration of 300 mg/kg empagliflozin and 60 mg/kg linagliptin in combination, yielding approximately 100 and 230 times the exposure to empagliflozin and linagliptin in patients at the maximum recommended human dose. Empagliflozin Empagliflozin administered during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic at doses up to 300 mg/kg in the rat or rabbit, which corresponds to approximately 48- and 122-times or 128- and 325-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin based on AUC exposure associated with the 25 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively. Doses of empagliflozin causing maternal toxicity in the rat also caused the malformation of bent limb bones at exposures approximately 155- and 393-times the clinical dose associated with the 25 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively. Maternally toxic doses in the rabbit also caused increased embryofetal loss at doses approximately 139- and 353-times the clinical dose associated with the 25 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively.

No adverse effects on postnatal development were noted at 10 mg/kg/day (maternal exposures approximately equivalent to those seen with a clinical dose of 25 mg). Specialised studies in rats with other members of the pharmacological class have shown toxicity to the developing kidney in the time period corresponding to the second and third trimesters of human pregnancy. Similar effects have been seen for empagliflozin at approximately 11 times the clinical AUC exposure associated with the 25 mg dose. These findings were absent after a 13 week drug-free recovery period. Linagliptin Linagliptin was shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits. In animal embryofetal development studies, linagliptin was shown to be not teratogenic in rats at oral doses up to 240 mg/kg/day (approximately 1,000 times the exposure in patients at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC) and up to 150 mg/kg/day in the rabbit (approximately 2,000 times human exposure).

Use in lactation No data in humans are available on excretion of empagliflozin and linagliptin into milk. Available nonclinical data in animals have shown excretion of empagliflozin and linagliptin and its metabolites in milk. It is recommended to discontinue breast feeding during treatment with GLYXAMBI. Empagliflozin GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 7 Reduced body weight was observed in rats exposed to empagliflozin in utero and through the consumption of maternal milk (see Use in pregnancy). Adverse effects on renal development have been observed in juvenile rats treated with other members of this pharmacological class. Similar effects were seen with empagliflozin but the findings were absent after a 13 week drug- free recovery. A risk to human newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Linagliptin Linagliptin and its metabolites were shown to be readily excreted in the milk of lactating rats. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.

During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg empagliflozin, equivalent to 32 times the daily recommended dose, were well tolerated. During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 600 mg linagliptin (equivalent to 120 times the recommended dose) were well tolerated. There is no experience with doses above 600 mg in humans. Treatment In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g. remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring and institute clinical measures as required.

Mechanism of action Combination empagliflozin/linagliptin Empagliflozin and linagliptin act by separate and complementary mechanisms to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (TD2M). The combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin, after single oral dosing, showed a superior effect on glycaemic control (oral glucose tolerance test) as compared to the respective monotherapies tested in diabetic ZDF rats. Empagliflozin Empagliflozin is a reversible competitive inhibitor of SGLT2 with an IC50 of 1.3 nM.

Empagliflozin Empagliflozin is a reversible competitive inhibitor of SGLT2 with an IC50 of 1.3 nM. It has a 5000-fold selectivity over human SGLT1 (IC50 of 6278 nM), responsible for glucose absorption in the gut. SGLT2 is highly expressed in the kidney, whereas expression in other tissues is absent or very low. It is responsible as the predominant transporter for re-absorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. In patients with T2DM and hyperglycaemia a higher amount of glucose is filtered and reabsorbed. Empagliflozin improves glycaemic control in patients with T2DM by reducing renal glucose re- absorption. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is dependent upon the blood glucose concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Through inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with T2DM and hyperglycaemia, excess glucose is excreted in the urine. In patients with T2DM, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following the first dose of empagliflozin and is continuous over the 24 hour dosing interval. Increased urinary glucose excretion was maintained at the end of 4-week treatment period, averaging approximately GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 13 78 g/day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily. Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in plasma glucose levels in patients with T2DM. Empagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels.

Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in plasma glucose levels in patients with T2DM. Empagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels. The insulin independent mechanism of action of empagliflozin contributes to a low risk of hypoglycaemia. The effect of empagliflozin in lowering blood glucose is independent of beta cell function and insulin pathway. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell function including Homeostasis Model Assessment-β (HOMA-β) and proinsulin to insulin ratio were noted. In addition urinary glucose excretion triggers calorie loss, associated with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The glucosuria observed with empagliflozin is accompanied by mild diuresis which may contribute to sustained and moderate reduction of blood pressure (BP). Linagliptin Linagliptin is an inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 an enzyme which is involved in the inactivation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP (glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). These hormones are rapidly degraded by the enzyme DPP-4. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretins are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Linagliptin binding to DPP-4 is reversible but long lasting and thus leads to a sustained increase and a"}

In vitro, linagliptin inhibits DPP- 4 with nanomolar potency and exhibits a >10000 fold selectivity versus DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity. Clinical trials A total of 2173 patients with T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control were treated in clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GLYXAMBI; 1005 patients were treated with empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg, and linagliptin 5 mg. In clinical trials, patients were treated for up to 24 or 52 weeks.

After oral administration, empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) with a median Cmax, (tmax) of 1.5 h post-dose. Thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow terminal phase.

Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner. The single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics parameters of empagliflozin were similar suggesting linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time.

GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 22 Administration of 25 mg empagliflozin after intake of a high-fat and high calorie meal resulted in slightly lower exposure; AUC decreased by approximately 16% and Cmax decreased by approximately 37%, compared to fasted condition. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not considered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food. Linagliptin The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin has been extensively characterised in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes.

After oral administration of a 5 mg dose to healthy volunteer patients, linagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1.5 hours post-dose. Plasma concentrations of linagliptin decline in a triphasic manner with a long terminal half-life (terminal half-life for linagliptin more than 100 hours), that is mostly related to the saturable, tight binding of linagliptin to DPP-4 and does not contribute to the accumulation of the drug. The effective half-life for accumulation of linagliptin, as determined from oral administration of multiple doses of 5 mg linagliptin, is approximately 12 hours. After once-daily dosing, steady- state plasma concentrations of 5 mg linagliptin are reached by the third dose. Plasma area under the curve (AUC) of linagliptin increased approximately 33% following 5 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for linagliptin AUC were small (12.6% and 28.5%, respectively).

Ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, led to a two-fold increase in exposure (AUC) and multiple co-administration of linagliptin with rifampicin, a potent inducer of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A, resulted in an approximate 40% decreased linagliptin steady- state AUC, presumably by increasing/decreasing the bioavailability of linagliptin by inhibition/induction of P-glycoprotein. Distribution Empagliflozin The apparent steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73.8 L, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects, the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 36.8% and plasma protein binding was 86.2%. Linagliptin As a result of tissue binding, the mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state following a single 5 mg intravenous dose of linagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 1110 litres, indicating that linagliptin extensively distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is concentration-dependent, decreasing from about 99% at 1 nmol/L to 75-89% at ≥30 nmol/L, reflecting saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin.

Systemic GLYXAMBI PI0160-14 23 exposure of each metabolite was less than 10% of total drug-related material. In vitro studies suggested that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9. Linagliptin Following a [14C]-linagliptin oral 10 mg dose, only 5% of the radioactivity was excreted in urine. Metabolism plays a subordinate role in the elimination of linagliptin. One main metabolite with a relative exposure of 13.3% of linagliptin at steady state was detected and was found to be pharmacologically inactive and thus does not contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of linagliptin. Excretion Empagliflozin The apparent terminal elimination half-life of empagliflozin was estimated to be 12.4 h and apparent oral clearance was 10.6 L/h based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis.

Creatinine clearance was measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance measurements or estimated from serum creatinine based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula: CrCl = [140 - age (years)] x weight (kg) {x 0.85 for female patients} / [72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)]. Under steady-state conditions, linagliptin exposure in patients with mild renal impairment was comparable to healthy subjects. In moderate renal impairment, a moderate increase in exposure of about 1.7-fold was observed compared with control.

These tumours are likely associated with a metabolic pathway not present in humans, and are considered to be irrelevant to patients given 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin. No drug-related tumours were seen in female mice or female rates at doses up to 1000 and 700 mg/kg/day, respectively, resulting in exposures at least 60 times that expected at the clinical dose of 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin. In male rats, treatment-related benign vascular proliferative lesions (haemangiomas) of the mesenteric lymph node, were observed at 700 mg/kg/day, but not at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 26- and 65-times the exposure at the clinical does of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively). These tumours are common in rats and are unlikely to be relevant to humans. Linagliptin No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed with linagliptin in 2-year studies in mice and rats given oral doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses correspond to approximately 300- and 400-times the human exposure (plasma AUC) at the MRHD of 5 mg/day.

Product details How do I use TRULICITY? 1. Why am I using TRULICITY? TRULICITY contains the active ingredient dulaglutide (rch). TRULICITY is a type of medicine called 'GLP-1 receptor agonists', which are used to help treat diabetes. Diabetes is a condition in which your pancreas does not produce enough insulin to control your blood sugar level. TRULICITY helps your body to produce more insulin when your blood sugar level is high. In adults with Type 2 diabetes, TRULICITY is used to improve blood sugar control and reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with or without existing cardiovascular disease. TRULICITY may be used alone or with other medicines to control your blood sugar levels. Your doctor may want you to use one or more other medicines in addition to TRULICITY, such as metformin, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione (TZD) or insulin.

Glyxambi contains the active ingredients empagliflozin (which belongs to a group of medicines called SGLT2 inhibitors) and linagliptin (belongs to a group of medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors). Both medicines work together to control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by increasing the amount of glucose expelled in urine, and producing more insulin to lower blood sugar levels. It may be used when diet plus exercise does not provide adequate blood sugar level control either: alone or with certain other medicines for diabetes such as metformin. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or NIDDM) develops if the body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin that your body makes does not work as well as it should. Lowering and controlling blood sugar levels may help prevent or delay complications of diabetes, such as heart disease, kidney disease, blindness and foot amputation. Continue to follow the diet and/or exercises recommended for you while you are on treatment with Glyxambi. 2. What should I know before I take Glyxambi?

QTERN is used when diet and exercise in combination with metformin do not provide adequate blood sugar level control. Type 2 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin and the insulin that your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood and can lead to serious medical problems. The main goal of treating type 2 diabetes is to control your blood sugar to a normal level. Lowering and controlling blood"}

Special Warnings and Precautions for Use 4.4 Ozempic should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Ozempic is not a substitute for insulin. Aspiration in association with general anaesthesia or deep sedation Cases of pulmonary aspiration have been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 RAs undergoing general anaesthesia (GA) or deep sedation despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. Therefore, the increased risk of residual gastric content because of delayed gastric emptying should be considered prior to performing procedures with GA or deep sedation. Gastrointestinal Effects Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions. This should be considered when treating patients with impaired renal function as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, may cause dehydration which could cause a deterioration of renal function. Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis, has been observed with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, Ozempic should be discontinued; if confirmed, Ozempic should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis.

The risk of hypoglycaemia can be lowered by reducing the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin when initiating treatment with Ozempic. Diabetic Retinopathy In patients with diabetic retinopathy treated with insulin and semaglutide, an increased risk of developing diabetic retinopathy complications has been observed (see section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable Effects)). Caution should be exercised when using semaglutide in patients with diabetic retinopathy treated with insulin. Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Long-term glycaemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for worsening and treated according to clinical guidelines. Acute kidney injury There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require haemodialysis, in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Some of these events have been reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or dehydration. Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses of Ozempic in patients reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions.

The potential effect of semaglutide on the absorption of co-administered oral medications was studied in trials at semaglutide 1 mg steady state exposure. No clinically relevant drug-drug interaction with semaglutide (Figure 1) was observed based on the evaluated medications. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required when co- administered with semaglutide. Relative exposure in terms of AUC and Cmax for each medication when given with semaglutide compared to without semaglutide. Metformin and oral contraceptive drug (ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel) were assessed at steady state. Warfarin (S-warfarin/R-warfarin), digoxin and atorvastatin were assessed after a single dose.

Upon initiation of semaglutide treatment in patients on warfarin or other coumarin derivatives, frequent monitoring of INR is recommended. 4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation Effects on fertility The effect of semaglutide on fertility in humans is unknown. Semaglutide did not affect male fertility in rats at daily SC doses of 828 μg/kg, resulting in exposures approximately 13 times the clinical AUC. In female rats, an increase in oestrous length and a small reduction in number of ovulations were observed at doses associated with maternal body weight loss (≥30 μg/kg/day SC, resulting in subclinical exposures). Use in pregnancy Pregnancy Category: D Semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential are recommended to use contraception when treated with semaglutide. If a patient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, semaglutide should be discontinued. Semaglutide should be discontinued at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long half-life (see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties). Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity when semaglutide was administered during organogenesis. In pregnant rats, embryofetal toxicity (lethality, impaired growth and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities) was observed at subclinical plasma exposures. Mechanistic studies suggest a direct GLP-1 receptor mediated role of semaglutide on some of the effects in rats (species specific). In pregnant rabbits, pharmacologically mediated reductions in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels. Early pregnancy losses"}

In pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, pharmacologically mediated, marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities (vertebra, sternebra, ribs) and with an increase in early pregnancy losses at ≥0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (>2.7 fold clinical exposure at 1 mg/week). Exposures at the NOAEL in all species were subclinical and a direct effect of semaglutide on the fetus cannot be excluded. Use in lactation In lactating rats, semaglutide was excreted in milk. A risk to a breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Semaglutide should not be used during breast-feeding. Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines 4.7 Ozempic has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines.

Most events were mild to moderate in severity and of short duration. The events led to treatment discontinuation in 3.9% and 5.9% of subjects. The events were most frequently reported during the first months on treatment. Patients with low body weight may experience more gastrointestinal side effects when treated with semaglutide. Acute pancreatitis The frequency of adjudication-confirmed acute pancreatitis reported in phase 3a clinical trials was 0.3% for semaglutide and 0.2% for the comparator, respectively. In the 2-year cardiovascular outcomes trial the frequency of acute pancreatitis confirmed by adjudication was 0.5% for semaglutide and 0.6% for placebo (see section 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use). Diabetic Retinopathy Complications In a 2-year clinical trial involving 3,297 patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, long duration of diabetes and poorly controlled blood glucose, adjudicated events of diabetic retinopathy complications occurred in more patients treated with Ozempic (3.0%) compared to placebo (1.8%).

Discontinuation Due to an Adverse Event The incidence of discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events was 6.1% and 8.7% for patients treated with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg respectively, versus 1.5% for placebo. The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation were gastrointestinal.

Heart Rate Increase Increased heart rate has been observed with GLP-1 receptor agonists. In the phase 3a trials, mean increases of 1 to 6 beats per minute (bpm) from a baseline of 72 to 76 bpm were observed in subjects treated with semaglutide. In a long-term trial in subjects with cardiovascular risk factors, 16% of semaglutide-treated subjects had an increase in heart rate of >10 bpm compared to 11% of subjects on placebo after 2 years of treatment. Increases in Amylase and Lipase In placebo-controlled trials, patients exposed to semaglutide had a mean increase from baseline in amylase of 13% and lipase of 22%. These changes were not observed in placebo- treated patients. In the absence of other signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic enzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis. Cholelithiasis In placebo-controlled trials, cholelithiasis was reported in 1.5% and 0.4% of patients-treated with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg respectively. Cholelithiasis was not reported in placebo- treated patients.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Pharmacodynamic Properties 5.1 Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, ATC code: A10BJ06. Mechanism of action Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence homology to human GLP-1. Semaglutide acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist that binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for native GLP-1. GLP-1 is a physiological hormone that has multiple actions in glucose and appetite regulation, in the cardiovascular system, and in the kidneys. The glucose and appetite effects are specifically mediated via GLP-1 receptors in the pancreas and the brain. GLP-1 receptors are also expressed in the heart, vasculature and immune system and kidney from where it may mediate cardiovascular and microvascular effects. Compared to native GLP-1, semaglutide has a prolonged half-life of around 1 week making it suitable for once weekly s.c. administration. The principal mechanism of protraction is albumin binding, which results in decreased renal clearance and protection from metabolic degradation. Furthermore, semaglutide is stabilised against degradation by the DPP-4 enzyme. Semaglutide reduces blood glucose through a mechanism where it stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, both in a glucose-dependent manner. Thus, when blood glucose is high, insulin secretion is stimulated and glucagon secretion is inhibited. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying in the early postprandial phase. During hypoglycaemia semaglutide diminishes insulin secretion and does not impair glucagon secretion. Semaglutide reduces body weight and body fat mass through lowered energy intake, involving an overall"}

Semaglutide reduces body weight and body fat mass through lowered energy intake, involving an overall reduced appetite, which includes increased satiety and reduced hunger, as well as improved control of eating and decreased food cravings. Insulin resistance is also reduced, probably through reduction in body weight. In addition, semaglutide reduces the preference for high fat foods. Semaglutide had a beneficial effect on plasma lipids, lowered systolic blood pressure and reduced inflammation in clinical studies. Ozempic Product Information - VV-LAB-098353 Page 11 of 34 In animal studies, semaglutide attenuates the development of atherosclerosis by preventing aortic plaque progression and reducing inflammation in the plaque. Clinical data showed that semaglutide lowered albuminuria in patients with kidney disease. Pharmacodynamic Effects All pharmacodynamic evaluations were performed after 12 weeks of treatment (including dose escalation) at steady state with semaglutide 1 mg once weekly. Fasting and Postprandial Glucose Semaglutide reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with semaglutide 1 mg resulted in reductions in glucose in terms of absolute change from baseline (mmol/L / mg/dL) and relative reduction compared to placebo (%) for fasting glucose (1.6 mmol/L / 29 mg/dL; 22%), 2 hour postprandial glucose (4.1mmol/L / 74 mg/dL; 37%), mean 24 hour glucose concentration (1.7 mmol/L / 30 mg/dL; 22% reduction) and postprandial"}

Absorption Maximum concentration was reached 1 to 3 days post dose. Steady-state exposure was achieved following 4-5 weeks of once weekly administration. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the mean steady state concentrations following s.c. administration of 0.5 mg and 1 mg semaglutide were approximately 16 nmol/L and 30 nmol/L, respectively. Semaglutide exposure increased in a dose proportional manner for doses of 0.5 mg and 1 mg. Similar exposure was achieved with s.c. administration of semaglutide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Absolute bioavailability of s.c semaglutide was 89%. Distribution The mean volume of distribution of semaglutide following s.c. administration in patients with type 2 diabetes was approximately 12.5 L. Semaglutide was extensively bound to plasma albumin (>99%). Metabolism Semaglutide is metabolised through proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential beta-oxidation of the fatty acid sidechain.

Special Populations No dose adjustment of semaglutide is needed based on age, gender, race, ethnicity, body weight, or renal or hepatic impairment. The effects of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide are shown in Figure 12 Figure 12: Impact of intrinsic factors on semaglutide exposure Age Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide based on data from phase 3a studies including patients of 20-86 years of age.

Paediatrics Semaglutide has not been studied in paediatric patients. 5.3 Preclinical Safety Data Genotoxicity Semaglutide was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, and was not clastogenic in vitro (cytogenetic assay in human lymphocytes), or in vivo (rat bone marrow micronucleus test). Carcinogenicity Non-lethal thyroid C-cell tumours observed in rodents are a class effect for GLP-1 receptor agonists. In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, semaglutide caused thyroid C-cell tumours at clinically relevant exposures (at ≥ x the clinical AUC in mice [based on the plasma AUC at the maximum recommended human dose of 1 mg/week] and subclinical exposures in rats; a no effect level was not established in either species). No other treatment-related tumours were observed. The rodent C-cell tumours are caused by a non- genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. The relevance for humans is considered to be low, but cannot be completely excluded. Juvenile toxicity In juvenile rats, semaglutide caused delayed sexual maturation in both males and females. These delays had no impact upon fertility and reproductive capacity of either sex, or on the ability of the females to maintain pregnancy. Ozempic"}

Ozempic® is also used to reduce the risk that your kidney disease worsens if you have type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Diabetes mellitus is a condition where your pancreas does not produce enough insulin to control the level of sugar in your blood or, your body is not able to use the insulin it makes properly.

The maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly is reached by starting with a weekly dose of 0.25 mg. To reduce the likelihood of gastrointestinal symptoms, the dose should be escalated over a 16-week period to a maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly (see Table 2). In case of significant gastrointestinal symptoms, consider delaying dose escalation until symptoms have improved. If patients do not tolerate the 2.4 mg dose, the dose can be decreased to a 1.7 mg weekly dose for maintenance. Patients should re-escalate the dose to 2.4 mg weekly, if tolerated.

Children and adolescents Safety and efficacy of Wegovy in children below 12 years have not been studied. For adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, the same dose escalation schedule as for adults should be applied (see Table 2). The dose should be increased until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg weekly or a lower maximum tolerated dose has been reached. Weekly doses higher than 2.4 mg are not recommended. It is recommended to regularly review the goals of treatment with Wegovy, particularly once the target weight (e.g. BMI <85th percentile) has been achieved. 4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (List of Excipients). 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE Aspiration in association with general anaesthesia or deep sedation Cases of pulmonary aspiration have been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 RAs undergoing general anaesthesia (GA) or deep sedation despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations.

This should be considered when treating patients with impaired renal function as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may cause dehydration which could cause a deterioration of renal function. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure, which have in some cases required haemodialysis, in patients treated with semaglutide. Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis, has been observed with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide. Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, Wegovy should be discontinued; if confirmed, Wegovy should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with Wegovy is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Populations not studied The safety and efficacy of Wegovy have not been investigated in patients: treated with other products for weight management, • • with type 1 diabetes, • with congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV.

There is limited experience with Wegovy in patients: • aged 85 years or more, • with inflammatory bowel disease, • with diabetic gastroparesis. Use with caution in these patients. Patients with type 2 diabetes Wegovy must not be used as a substitute for insulin in patients with diabetes. Semaglutide should not be used in combination with other GLP-1 receptor agonist products. It has not been evaluated and an increased risk of adverse reactions related to overdose is considered likely. Hypoglycaemia in patients with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes Insulin and sulfonylurea are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Patients treated with Wegovy in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia can be lowered by reducing the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin when initiating treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonists.

No clinically relevant effect on the rate of gastric emptying was observed with semaglutide 2.4 mg. In clinical pharmacology trials assessing the effect of semaglutide 1.0 mg on the absorption of co- administered oral medications at steady state no clinically relevant drug-drug interactions with semaglutide (Figure 1) was observed based on the evaluated medications. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required when co-administered with semaglutide.

Abbreviations: AUC: area under the curve. Cmax: maximum concentration. CI: confidence interval Oral contraceptives Semaglutide is not anticipated to decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives as semaglutide did not change the overall exposure of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel to a clinically relevant degree, when an oral contraceptive combination medicinal product (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol/0.15 mg levonorgestrel) was co-administered with semaglutide. Exposure of ethinylestradiol was not affected; an increase of 20% was observed for levonorgestrel exposure at steady state. Cmax was not affected for any of the compounds. Atorvastatin Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure of atorvastatin following a single dose administration of atorvastatin (40 mg). Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38%. This was assessed not to be clinically relevant. Digoxin Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure or Cmax of digoxin following a single dose of digoxin (0.5 mg).

However, cases of decreased INR have been reported during concomitant use of acenocoumarol and semaglutide. Upon initiation of semaglutide treatment in patients on warfarin or other coumarin derivatives, frequent monitoring of INR is recommended. 4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Effects on fertility The effect of semaglutide on fertility in humans is unknown. Semaglutide did not affect male fertility in rats at daily subcutaneous (s.c.) doses of 828 μg/kg, resulting in exposures approximately 4.5 times the clinical AUC. In female rats, an increase in oestrous length and a small reduction in number of ovulations were observed at doses associated with maternal body weight loss (≥30 μg/kg/day SC, resulting in subclinical exposures). Use in pregnancy – Pregnancy Category D Semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential are recommended to use contraception when treated with semaglutide. If a patient wishes to become pregnant, or pregnancy occurs, semaglutide should be discontinued. Semaglutide should be discontinued at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long half-life (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties). Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity when semaglutide was administered during organogenesis. In pregnant rats, embryofetal toxicity (lethality, impaired growth and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities) was observed"}

Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity when semaglutide was administered during organogenesis. In pregnant rats, embryofetal toxicity (lethality, impaired growth and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities) was observed at subclinical plasma exposures. Mechanistic studies suggest a direct GLP-1 receptor mediated role of semaglutide on some of the effects in rats (species Wegovy® Product Information Page 7 of 42 specific). In pregnant rabbits, pharmacologically mediated reductions in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels. Early pregnancy losses and increased incidences of minor visceral (kidney, liver) and skeletal (sternebra) fetal abnormalities were observed at ≥0.0025 mg/kg/day, at clinically relevant exposures. In pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, pharmacologically mediated, marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities (vertebra, sternebra, ribs) and with an increase in early pregnancy losses at ≥0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (>1.4- fold clinical exposure at 2.4 mg/week). Exposures at the NOAEL in all species were subclinical and a direct effect of semaglutide on the fetus cannot be excluded. Use in lactation In lactating rats, semaglutide was excreted in milk. A risk to a breast-fed child cannot be excluded.

For information on the management of overdose, contact the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 (Australia). 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES Mechanism of action Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence homology to human GLP-1. Semaglutide acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist that binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for native GLP-1. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator and has multiple actions in glucose and appetite regulation. The glucose and appetite effects are specifically mediated via GLP-1 receptors in the pancreas and the brain. Clinical studies show that semaglutide reduces energy intake, increases feelings of satiety, fullness and control of eating, and reduces feelings of hunger, and frequency and intensity of cravings. Animal studies show that semaglutide works in the brain through the GLP-1 receptor. Semaglutide has direct effects on areas in the brain involved in homeostatic regulation of food intake in the hypothalamus and the brainstem. Semaglutide affects the hedonic reward system through direct and indirect effects in brain areas including the septum, thalamus and amygdala. Semaglutide has shown an effect to change food intake in animals away from more rewarding high fat, sweet items. Semaglutide orchestrates the homeostatic and hedonic contributions with executive function to regulate caloric intake, appetite, reward and food choice. In addition, in clinical studies semaglutide have shown to reduce"}

Semaglutide has shown an effect to change food intake in animals away from more rewarding high fat, sweet items. Semaglutide orchestrates the homeostatic and hedonic contributions with executive function to regulate caloric intake, appetite, reward and food choice. In addition, in clinical studies semaglutide have shown to reduce blood glucose through a mechanism where it stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, both in a glucose- dependent manner. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying in the early postprandial phase. During hypoglycaemia, semaglutide diminishes insulin secretion and does not impair glucagon secretion. The mechanism of action of semaglutide for cardiovascular risk reduction has not been established. Weight loss distribution In a sub-study in STEP 1 (N = 140), body composition was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The results of the DEXA assessment showed that treatment with Wegovy was accompanied by greater reduction in fat mass than in lean body mass leading to an improvement in body composition compared to placebo after 68 weeks. Furthermore, this reduction in total fat mass was accompanied by a reduction in visceral fat. In the semaglutide group, there was a mean (SD) decrease in total fat mass proportion of 3.9%-points (5.4%-points), an increase in lean body mass proportion of 3.4% (5.1%) and a decrease in regional visceral fat mass proportion of 2.2%-points (4.4%). These results suggest that most of the total weight loss was attributable to a reduction in fat tissue, including visceral fat."}

These results suggest that most of the total weight loss was attributable to a reduction in fat tissue, including visceral fat. Appetite regulation, energy intake and food choice Wegovy reduces appetite by increasing feelings of fullness and satiety, while lowering hunger and prospective food consumption. In a phase 1 trial, energy intake during an ad libitum meal was 35% lower with Wegovy compared to placebo after 20 weeks of dosing. This was supported by improved control of eating, less food cravings (for dairy and savoury foods), less desire for sweet food and a relatively lower preference for high fat food.

Semaglutide did not prolong QTc intervals at doses up to 1.5 mg at steady state. The semaglutide exposure for subjects with overweight or obesity treated with Wegovy is comparable to the exposure evaluated in the semaglutide QTc study in healthy volunteers.

Furthermore, the two-year efficacy and safety of Wegovy compared to placebo were evaluated in a double-blinded randomised placebo- controlled phase 3b trial (STEP 5) including 304 patients (152 on treatment with Wegovy). Treatment with Wegovy demonstrated superior, clinically meaningful, and sustained weight loss compared with placebo in patients with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity (Figure 2). Furthermore, across the trials, a higher proportion of patients achieved ≥5%, ≥10% and ≥15% weight loss with Wegovy compared with placebo. Treatment with Wegovy also showed statistically significant improvements in waist circumference and systolic blood pressure compared to placebo. Wegovy also showed statistically significant improvements in physical functioning compared to placebo, except for STEP 3 where the improvement was not statistically significant.

The principal mechanism of protraction is albumin binding, which results in decreased renal clearance and protection from metabolic degradation. Furthermore, semaglutide is stabilised against degradation by the DPP-4 enzyme. Absorption The average semaglutide steady state concentration following s.c. administration of Wegovy was approximately 75 nmol/L in patients with either overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) or obesity Wegovy® Product Information Page 35 of 42 (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). The steady state exposure of semaglutide increased proportionally with doses up to 2.4 mg once weekly. Similar exposure was achieved with s.c. administration of semaglutide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. The absolute bioavailability of semaglutide was 89% Distribution The mean volume of distribution of semaglutide following s.c. administration in patients with overweight or obesity is approximately 12.4 L. Semaglutide is extensively bound to plasma albumin (> 99%). Metabolism Semaglutide is metabolised through proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential beta-oxidation of the fatty acid side chain. Excretion Semaglutide has pharmacokinetic properties compatible with once-weekly administration, with an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week. The primary excretion routes of semaglutide-related material are via the urine and faeces. Approximately 3% of the dose was excreted in the urine as intact semaglutide. Clearance of semaglutide in patient with overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2) or obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) was approximately 0.05 L/h. With an elimination half-life of approximately"}

With an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week, semaglutide can be present in the circulation for approximately 7 weeks after the last dose of 2.4 mg. Special populations Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, sex, race, and ethnicity, and renal impairment do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. The exposure of semaglutide decreases with an increase in body weight. However, semaglutide 2.4 mg provide adequate systemic exposure over the body weight range of 54.4-245.6 kg evaluated in the clinical trials.

Renal impairment Renal impairment did not impact the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide in a clinically relevant manner. This was shown with a single dose of 0.5 mg semaglutide for patients with different degrees of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe or subjects in dialysis) compared with subjects with normal renal function.

The semaglutide exposure in adolescents was similar to that in adults with obesity or overweight. 5.3 PRECLINICAL SAFETY DATA Genotoxicity Semaglutide was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, and was not clastogenic in vitro (cytogenetic assay in human lymphocytes), or in vivo (rat bone marrow micronucleus test). Carcinogenicity Non-lethal thyroid C-cell tumours observed in rodents are a class effect for GLP-1 receptor agonists. In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, semaglutide caused thyroid C-cell tumours at clinically relevant exposures (at ≥ 1.2× the clinical AUC in mice [based on the plasma AUC at the maximum recommended human dose of 2.4 mg/week] and subclinical exposures in rats; a no effect level was not established in either species). No other treatment-related tumours were observed. The rodent C-cell tumors are caused by a non-genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. The relevance for humans is considered to be low, but cannot be excluded. Juvenile toxicity In juvenile rats, semaglutide caused delayed sexual maturation in both males and females. These delays had no impact upon fertility and reproductive capacity of either sex, or on the ability of the females to maintain pregnancy. 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 LIST OF EXCIPIENTS Single-dose pen Dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate Sodium chloride Hydrochloric acid Sodium hydroxide Water for injections FlexTouch pen Dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate Propylene glycol Phenol Hydrochloric acid Sodium hydroxide Water for"}

Hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus Patients receiving tirzepatide in combination with an insulin secretagogue (for example, a sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin (see sections 4.2 Dose and method of administration and 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). Gastrointestinal effects Tirzepatide has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, which include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea (see section 4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)). These events may lead to dehydration, which could cause a deterioration in renal function, including acute renal failure.

No data are available. Effects on laboratory tests No information on the effect of tirzepatide on laboratory tests is available. 4.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying and has the potential to affect the rate of absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. This effect, resulting in decreased Cmax and a delayed tmax, is most pronounced at the time of tirzepatide treatment initiation. Based on the results from a study with paracetamol, which was used as a model medicinal product to evaluate the effect of tirzepatide on gastric emptying, it is not anticipated that tirzepatide treatment will result in a clinically meaningful impact on orally administered drugs that do not have a narrow therapeutic index. However, it is recommended to monitor patients on oral medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin, digoxin), especially during the early phase of treatment with tirzepatide and following any dose increase. The risk of delayed effect should also"}

However, it is recommended to monitor patients on oral medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin, digoxin), especially during the early phase of treatment with tirzepatide and following any dose increase. The risk of delayed effect should also be considered for any oral medicinal product for which a rapid onset of effect is important. Oral contraceptives Administration of a combination oral contraceptive (0.035 mg ethinylestradiol plus 0.25 mg norgestimate) in the presence of a single dose of tirzepatide (5 mg) resulted in a reduction of oral contraceptive Cmax by 55 to 66%, with a 16 to 23% reduction in area under the curve (AUC) and a delay in tmax of 2.5 to 4.5 hours. This reduction in exposure after a single 5 mg dose of tirzepatide is not considered clinically relevant. Doses other than a single 5 mg dose of tirzepatide were not investigated in this interaction study. The reduction in exposure described above may be significant in a setting with concomitant administration of medicines also affecting those exposures. Appropriate contraception methods (including non-oral contraceptives) should be discussed with the patient based on the patient’s individual circumstances prior to commencing tirzepatide. Reduced efficacy of oral contraceptives cannot be excluded, it is therefore advised that patients using oral hormonal contraceptives switch to a non-oral contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation with MOUNJARO. 4.6"}

Tirzepatide did not affect fertility in male rats at doses up to 3 mg/kg/day, resulting in exposures 2 times the clinical AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). In female rats, prolonged oestrus cycling and decreases in the mean numbers of corpora lutea, vA10.0_Sept2025 Supersedes: vA9.0_June2025 Page 7 of 35 implantation sites, and viable embryos per litter was observed at subclinical exposures based on AUC at the MRHD. Use in pregnancy Pregnancy Category D. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of tirzepatide in pregnant women. Tirzepatide should not be used during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential are advised to use contraception during treatment with tirzepatide (see section 4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions). If a patient wishes to become pregnant or becomes pregnant, treatment with tirzepatide should be discontinued. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity when tirzepatide was administered during organogenesis. In pregnant rats, embryofetal toxicity (increased post-implantation loss, impaired growth and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities) was observed at subclinical plasma exposures. All developmental effects occurred at maternally toxic doses. Exposures at the No"}

Exposures at the No Observed Adverse Effects Level (NOAEL) were subclinical and a direct effect of tirzepatide on the fetus cannot be excluded. Use in lactation It is unknown whether tirzepatide is excreted in human milk. Administer tirzepatide to nursing women only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the infant. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. When tirzepatide is used in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines (see section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). 4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS) Summary of safety profile Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In 7 completed phase 3 studies, 5,119 patients were exposed to tirzepatide alone or in combination with other glucose lowering medicinal products.

Mechanism of action Tirzepatide is a long-acting GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist. It is an amino acid sequence with a C20 fatty diacid moiety that enables albumin binding and prolongs half-life. Both receptors are present on the pancreatic α and β endocrine cells, brain, heart, vasculature, immune cells (leukocytes), gut and kidney. GIP receptors are also present on adipocytes. Tirzepatide is selective to human GIP and GLP-1 receptors. Tirzepatide has high affinity to both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors. The activity of tirzepatide on the GIP receptor is similar to native GIP hormone. The activity of tirzepatide on the GLP-1 receptor is lower compared to native GLP-1 hormone. Tirzepatide is a biased agonist at the GLP-1 receptor with preferential signaling towards the activation of adenylyl cyclase as opposed to the recruitment of β -"}

Insulin secretion Tirzepatide increases β - cell glucose sensitivity. In a hyperglycaemic clamp study in patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide was compared to placebo and the selective GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide 1mg for insulin secretion. Tirzepatide 15 mg enhanced the first- and second-phase insulin secretion rate by 466% and 302% from baseline, respectively, in a glucose dependent manner. There was no change in first- and second-phase insulin secretion rate for placebo and the rates increased for semaglutide 1 mg by 298% and 223%, respectively. Insulin sensitivity Tirzepatide 15 mg improved whole body insulin sensitivity by 63%, as measured by M-value, a measure of glucose tissue uptake using hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic clamp. The M-value was unchanged for placebo and increased in semaglutide 1 mg by 35%. Tirzepatide lowers body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes, which may contribute to improvement in insulin sensitivity. Reduced food intake with tirzepatide contributes to body weight loss.

Tirzepatide 15 mg reduced fasting glucagon concentration by 28% and glucagon AUC after a mixed meal by 43%, compared with no change for placebo, and decreases for semaglutide 1mg in fasting glucagon by 22% and in glucagon AUC by 29%. Gastric emptying Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying, with largest delay after the first dose and this effect diminishes over time. Slowing post-meal glucose absorption and can lead to a beneficial effect on postprandial glycaemia. Energy intake In patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide reduced food intake contributing to body weight loss. In pre-clinical rodent studies tirzepatide induced a preference to lower fat food. Appetite Regulation Tirzepatide regulates appetite and decreases food intake. Both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors are found in areas of the brain that are important for appetite regulation. Body Weight Tirzepatide reduces and controls body weight.

The secondary objectives included body weight, fasting serum glucose (FSG) and proportion of patients reaching target HbA1c. All five phase 3 studies assessed tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg. All patients treated with tirzepatide started with 2.5 mg for 4 weeks. Then the dose of tirzepatide was increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until they reached their assigned dose. Across all studies, treatment with tirzepatide demonstrated sustained, statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions from baseline in HbA1c and body weight compared to either placebo or active control treatment (semaglutide, insulin degludec and insulin glargine) for up to 1 year.

Significant reductions from baseline in FSG could be observed as early as 2 weeks. The improvement in FSG was sustained through the longest study duration of 104 weeks. Postprandial glucose Treatment with tirzepatide resulted in significant reductions in mean 2 -hour post prandial glucose (mean of 3 main meals of the day) from baseline (changes from baseline to primary end point were - 3.35 mmol/L to - 4.85 mmol/L).

Steady state exposure is achieved following 4 weeks of once weekly administration. Tirzepatide exposure increases in a dose proportional manner. Similar exposure was achieved with subcutaneous administration of tirzepatide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Absolute bioavailability of subcutaneous tirzepatide was 80%. Distribution The mean apparent steady-state volume of distribution of tirzepatide following subcutaneous administration in patients with type 2 diabetes is approximately 10.3 L in patients with type 2 diabetes and 9.7 L in patients with obesity. Tirzepatide is highly bound to plasma albumin (99%). Metabolism Tirzepatide is metabolised by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone, beta-oxidation of the C20 fatty diacid moiety and amide hydrolysis. Excretion The apparent population mean clearance of tirzepatide is approximately 0.06 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 5 days, enabling once weekly administration. Tirzepatide is eliminated by metabolism. The primary excretion routes of tirzepatide metabolites are via urine and faeces.

Renal impairment Renal impairment does not impact the PK of tirzepatide. The PK of tirzepatide after a single 5 mg dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe, ESRD) compared with subjects with normal renal function. This was also shown for patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal impairment based on data from clinical studies. Hepatic impairment Hepatic impairment does not impact the PK of tirzepatide. The PK of tirzepatide after a single 5 mg dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, severe) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function.
